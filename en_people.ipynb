It took only 16 seconds for the platform to predict the protein chains of 400 amino acids. Photo shows Xue Guirong, founder of Shanghai-based Chinese artificial intelligence startup Tianrang. (File photo) Proteins are major functional molecules that play a variety of roles in cells. For instance, as a catalyzing enzyme, they adjust metabolism and carry metabolic substances to form cytoskeletons. Besides, they also join the immunologic, cell differentiation and apoptosis process. To decode the functions of proteins, a basic element composing life forms, is fundamental to uncovering the secrets of biological phenomena. Xue Guirong, founder of Tianrang, introduced that proteins must fold into particular structures in order to perform their functions. Only a few types of proteins are functional when they are not folding. The functions of proteins are determined by their three-dimensional structures. Once the structures are damaged, the proteins lose their functions. Many diseases are caused by abnormal structures of important proteins. Therefore, the studies on protein structures lead to better understanding of proteins’ functions, thus stimulate improvement in healthcare, food sustainability and innovative biotechnology, and promote the development of life science, R&D of drugs and synthetic biology. The observation and analysis of protein structure have always been a fascinating topic in life science which many scientists are studying. However, the study is difficult and costly, and facing limited progress. Photo shows the structure of a type of protein. The green part is the real structure, while the blue part is the prediction. (Photo from the website of Tianrang) There are three major traditional methods to observe protein structures - magnetic resonance imaging, radiology and cryogenic electron microscopy. These methods need huge trial and error and expensive devices, and normally take years to complete the study of a single structure. In addition, these experimental methods are not capable enough to reveal some important protein structures, and more bioinformation technologies and computational biology approaches are needed. However, usual computer software could not take the astonishingly massive computing volume of protein structure, and even supercomputers are not able to do that. Therefore, protein structure prediction has become an important branch of structural biology, and researchers predict spatial structure of proteins based on amino acid sequence through relevant AI algorithm they have developed. “AI is showing surprising decision-making capabilities in dealing with complicated systematic problems, from defeating the world champion of the Go game, to managing urban traffic. The prediction of protein structures, though a biological issue, is also a problem in complicated scenarios where AI can demonstrate its huge potential in handling basic science research. That’s something we don’t want to miss,” said Xue. Photo shows the structure of a type of protein. The green part is the real structure, while the blue part is the prediction. (Photo from the website of Tianrang) Such a project is very precious, as it has made innovations in inter-discipline studies, industry, basic science, AI algorithms and engineering capability, Xue noted. The recent progress indicated that the application of AI in the studies of protein structure can decode some structures that are not able to be analyzed through traditional observation methods, and the results are reliable and very close to the fact. Such AI-powered structure prediction is expected to become a sharp tool of scientists and accelerate the development of research in life science. At present, the prediction of single protein folding is just a start. Proteins often function as compounds in pairs or groups, and the structures of many protein compounds are still a mystery. Xue believes that the adaptability and precision of AI algorithms shall be further improved, so as to make contributions to revealing how proteins interact with each other and help mankind find new and accurate ways to cure diseases.

Published on Sunday in scientific journal Viruses, the team analyzed over 1,500 fragments of SARS-CoV-2's viral proteins, called epitopes, that have been found to be recognized by T cells in recovered COVID-19 patients or after vaccination. The team's findings suggested that Omicron is unlikely to be able to evade T cells. Even if Omicron, or some other variant for that matter, can potentially escape antibodies, a robust T cell response can still be expected to offer protection and help to prevent significant illness, according to the research team. The team anticipated that T cell responses elicited by vaccines and boosters will continue to help protect people against Omicron and other variants. (Web editor: Xia Peiyao, Hongyu)\n",

As planned, Chang'e-7 probe will be launched to the south pole of the moon first. Since Chang'e-6 is a backup of Chang'e-5 sample-return mission, it will be launched after Chang'e-7 to bring back samples on the lunar south pole. Chang'e-6 mission will be followed by Chang'e-8, a step toward building a model of a lunar scientific research station. \"We also prepare to work with Russia to build the basic model of the lunar research station,\" Wu said in a recent interview. \"The construction of the station will lay a solid foundation for us to better explore the lunar environment and resources, including how to use and develop lunar resources peacefully.\" The Chang'e-5 probe was launched in 2020, having retrieved a total of 1,731 grams of lunar samples.

BEIJING, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- China released on the first day of 2022 a group of new Mars images sent by the Tianwen-1 probe. These new images showed diverse working conditions of the probe's orbiter and rover, as well as the Mars surface topography obtained by them, said the China National Space Administration (CNSA). The images include the group photo of the orbiter and Mars, closeup of the orbiter, ice sheet on Mars' north pole area, surface landscape taken by the rover Zhurong. China's Tianwen-1 mission, consisting of an orbiter, a lander and a rover, was launched on July 23, 2020. The lander, carrying the rover with an expected life span of at least 90 Martian days or about three months on Earth, touched down in the southern part of Utopia Planitia, a vast plain in the northern hemisphere of Mars, on May 15. Zhurong drove down from its landing platform to the Martian surface on May 22, starting its exploration of the red planet. As of Dec. 31, 2021, the Tianwen-1 orbiter had been working in orbit for 526 days, at a distance of about 350 million km above Earth. Zhurong had been working on the surface of the Red Planet for 225 Martian days and traveled 1,400 meters, according to the CNSA. The Tianwen-1 mission is carrying out the planned exploration and test tasks, obtaining about 560 gigabytes (GB) of data. Both the orbiter and rover are in good condition and operating normally, the CNSA said. (Web editor: Zhong Wenxing, Bianji)\n",

(Xinhua/Jin Liangkuai) BEIJING, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- Three Chinese astronauts in space station Tiangong held a video chat with students in Beijing, Hong Kong and Macao Saturday afternoon, the first day of 2022. The live space-Earth talk was attended by around 500 young students at the three venues. The astronauts shared their space dream and aspirations. Astronaut Zhai Zhigang, commander of the Shenzhou-13 mission, shared his experience with the young people and encouraged them to overcome difficulties and dangers. \"No matter how far we fly, the motherland is forever our strongest supporter. Love for the country always inspires us in space flights,\" Zhai said. Astronaut Wang Yaping expressed hope that the live class from Tiangong could guide more young people to look up at the stars and plant the seeds of \"loving science, pursuing dreams and exploring the unknown\" in their hearts. Wang earned the title of China's first space teacher after delivering a televised science lecture during the Shenzhou-10 space mission in June 2013. While in the Shenzhou-13 mission, she and the other two crew members also gave a lecture in Tiangong in December 2021. As China's national space laboratory, the space station Tiangong is expected to play a unique role in encouraging the public, especially the youth, to explore space and carry forward the scientific spirit. \"Despite being weightless in space, we feel firmly grounded at heart,\" said astronaut Ye Guangfu, a newcomer to space. With the support of space professionals, painstaking trainings, and valuable experience from aerospace predecessors, Ye said that they have the confidence, determination and ability to accomplish the mission. Tan Zuwei, student of the School of Aerospace Engineering of Tsinghua University, felt deeply impressed by the astronauts' passion for their dreams and the space cause. He said he was inspired by their spirit and would contribute to the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. Zhou Ting, a medical student from the University of Hong Kong (HKU), felt lucky to pose her question to the astronauts. \"As a would-be doctor, I have been confronted with harsh study and work, and I sometimes thought of giving up. But the astronauts have given me the courage to carry on.\" Qian Chunzheng, a freshman from the Macao University of Science and Technology (MUST), said that he felt the care of the motherland for students in Hong Kong and Macao, and the development and progress of the country's space cause. All this has enhanced their sense of pride and duty to the country. \"As we have our own space station right now, I believe that in the future, Chinese people will surely step further into deep space.

It took only 16 seconds for the platform to predict the protein chains of 400 amino acids. Photo shows Xue Guirong, founder of Shanghai-based Chinese artificial intelligence startup Tianrang. (File photo) Proteins are major functional molecules that play a variety of roles in cells. For instance, as a catalyzing enzyme, they adjust metabolism and carry metabolic substances to form cytoskeletons. Besides, they also join the immunologic, cell differentiation and apoptosis process. To decode the functions of proteins, a basic element composing life forms, is fundamental to uncovering the secrets of biological phenomena. Xue Guirong, founder of Tianrang, introduced that proteins must fold into particular structures in order to perform their functions. Only a few types of proteins are functional when they are not folding. The functions of proteins are determined by their three-dimensional structures. Once the structures are damaged, the proteins lose their functions. Many diseases are caused by abnormal structures of important proteins. Therefore, the studies on protein structures lead to better understanding of proteins’ functions, thus stimulate improvement in healthcare, food sustainability and innovative biotechnology, and promote the development of life science, R&D of drugs and synthetic biology. The observation and analysis of protein structure have always been a fascinating topic in life science which many scientists are studying. However, the study is difficult and costly, and facing limited progress. Photo shows the structure of a type of protein. The green part is the real structure, while the blue part is the prediction. (Photo from the website of Tianrang) There are three major traditional methods to observe protein structures - magnetic resonance imaging, radiology and cryogenic electron microscopy. These methods need huge trial and error and expensive devices, and normally take years to complete the study of a single structure. In addition, these experimental methods are not capable enough to reveal some important protein structures, and more bioinformation technologies and computational biology approaches are needed. However, usual computer software could not take the astonishingly massive computing volume of protein structure, and even supercomputers are not able to do that. Therefore, protein structure prediction has become an important branch of structural biology, and researchers predict spatial structure of proteins based on amino acid sequence through relevant AI algorithm they have developed. “AI is showing surprising decision-making capabilities in dealing with complicated systematic problems, from defeating the world champion of the Go game, to managing urban traffic. The prediction of protein structures, though a biological issue, is also a problem in complicated scenarios where AI can demonstrate its huge potential in handling basic science research. That’s something we don’t want to miss,” said Xue. Photo shows the structure of a type of protein. The green part is the real structure, while the blue part is the prediction. (Photo from the website of Tianrang) Such a project is very precious, as it has made innovations in inter-discipline studies, industry, basic science, AI algorithms and engineering capability, Xue noted. The recent progress indicated that the application of AI in the studies of protein structure can decode some structures that are not able to be analyzed through traditional observation methods, and the results are reliable and very close to the fact. Such AI-powered structure prediction is expected to become a sharp tool of scientists and accelerate the development of research in life science. At present, the prediction of single protein folding is just a start. Proteins often function as compounds in pairs or groups, and the structures of many protein compounds are still a mystery. Xue believes that the adaptability and precision of AI algorithms shall be further improved, so as to make contributions to revealing how proteins interact with each other and help mankind find new and accurate ways to cure diseases.

An unexpected discovery of a new microbe by Chinese scientists, recently published in the journal Nature, proves that such conversion can be done by a single type of archaea alone. It paves the way for further exploitation of depleted oil fields, the China Science Daily reported. CRUDE OIL EATERS Previous studies found that the degradation of crude oil into methane needs the co-existence of two different types of microbes: hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria and methanogenic archaea. Methane is a major component of natural gas and biogas and is often used as a fuel and starting material in chemical synthesis. \"There is close cooperation between them. If split apart, they can't do the job,\" said Li Meng, one of the correspondent authors of the paper and a professor with Archaeal Biology Center, Institute for Advanced Study, Shenzhen University. Archaea have existed on Earth for approximately 3.5 billion years. They exist in extreme environments like hydrothermal vents on the seafloor, hot springs, and saline-alkali lakes. Methanogenic archaea are a family of anaerobic archaea that produce methane without oxygen, playing a significant role in biogas fermentation. Previous studies found that methanogenic archaea produce methane in four ways -- acetic-acid fermentation, CO2 reduction, methyl cracking, and oxymethyl conversion. The raw materials are simple organics, mainly compounds with one or two carbon atoms. \"Textbooks told us methanogenic archaea can't directly 'eat' complex organics such as alkyl hydrocarbons with dozens of carbon atoms. And there was no study about microbes that directly degrade petroleum hydrocarbon into methane or CO2,\" said Cheng Lei, another correspondent author and a researcher with the Biogas Institute of China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs. However, hydrocarbon degradation by bacteria and archaea takes a long time and is unstable. It makes it challenging to develop for engineering applications. The Biogas Institute has carried out fundamental research on anaerobic microbes for 40 years. It has preserved nearly 600 anaerobic microbe model species, while global research institutions have over 2,000. Anaerobic microbes host abundant biological resources on Earth, but only less than 0.1 percent of them are known, said Zhou Zhuo from the Biogas Institute, the first author of the paper. Most anaerobic microbes are \"dark matters.\" Scientists know they exist, but don't know what they are, said Zhou. UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY The research team from the Biogas Institute has studied anaerobic degradation since 2005, but the work was challenging from the start. \"It often takes one or two years for anaerobic microbes to complete the growth cycle to degrade the petroleum hydrocarbon. The longest reported time was over 800 days,\" said Cheng Lei. In 2019, they spotted a sample from an oil deposit with a growth cycle of two to three months. \"It's an unexpected discovery. The growth cycle was much shorter, so we were very interested,\" Cheng recalled. \"We wanted to know what kind of microbe can convert petroleum hydrocarbon so quickly.\" In 2019, scientists from the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology of Germany put forward a hypothesis that a new type of archaea, named Ca. Methanoliparia, may have the ability to independently degrade long-chain alkyl hydrocarbons to produce methane. But there was no supporting evidence at the time. Cheng Lei said they found the trace of these new archaea in the sample. But there were many microbes mixed, and they needed evidence to prove that the new archaea could do the job alone. The team used a stable carbon isotope labeling test to confirm that the normal alkane added into the sample converted into methane and carbon dioxide. Then they found Ca. Methanoliparia with the key intermediate metabolites in methane production from alkane degradation and confirmed its carbon metabolism pathway. The result indicated that the new archaea could directly oxidize long-chain alkyl hydrocarbons without the help of bacteria, providing the fifth way to produce methane. UNDERGROUND BIOGAS In traditional oil field recoveries, the crude oil deep underground is driven by water pressure or chemicals and pumped to the surface. More than half of the deposits are challenging to recover by conventional technology and stay underground in depleted oil fields. The head of the Biogas Institute, Wang Dengshan, believed this from-zero-to-one discovery lays a foundation for underground biogas development to revive depleted oil fields. \"We don't need to pump out the oil left underground. We can turn it into methane and collect it. It's equivalent to a massive underground biogas pool built in the crude oil deposit, on a scale of square kilometers,\" said Wang. If the technology based on this research is applied to depleted oil fields in China, there will be hundreds of millions of tonnes of extra oil and gas for exploitation. Compared with conventional petrochemistry, the biological conversion could directly produce methane without carbon emissions from crude oil exploitation, refining, and chemical processing, he said. The new archaea may also have a further application prospect in synthetic biology. (Web editor: Xia Peiyao, Liang Jun)\n",

Based on a large number of animal experiments, research teams from the Beijing Friendship Hospital and the First Hospital of Lanzhou University used a domestically developed surgical robot to perform a single-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A single-port laparoscopic surgery is generally performed in the thoracic or abdominal cavity through a single small incision of two to three centimeters on the surface of the body. The domestically developed surgical robot uses a unique single-arm technology and is flexible and easy to operate. The high dexterity of the snake-shaped device allows for seven degrees of freedom in a limited space, said Zhang Zhongtao, leader of the research team and a professor at Capital Medical University. He noted that compared with the conventional multi-port laparoscopic surgery, the single-port surgery is a promising clinical solution thanks to its smaller incision, less invasion of tissues, shorter positioning time and larger positioning space for the robotic system. Previously, the domestically developed surgical robot assisted clinical experts in many difficult operations, including urologic surgery, general surgery, thoracic surgery and gynecologic surgery, creating vital clinical value.

Rice paper, or Chinese art paper, is made from bark and straw through over a hundred processes. By studying the structure of the paper, researchers with the USTC have found that a large number of nanofibers and micron fibers interwoven in rice paper endow it with the advantages of high strength and flexibility. Thanks to these properties, the film shows no destructive creases after being completely folded. It can also return to its original shape after being rolled up. In addition, the film is more thermally stable than the widely used petroleum-based plastic film, showing no considerable change even at a temperature of 250 degrees centigrade. These mechanical, thermodynamic and optical characteristics make the film an ideal material for manufacturing precision optical and flexible electronic devices. The finding has been published in the journal ACS Materials Letters. (Web editor: Xia Peiyao, Liang Jun)\n",

In a seven-hour experiment which took place in September this year, algae were carried by a helium balloon to an altitude of 30,000 meters and survived for four hours in lower than minus 30 degrees Celsius with intense ultraviolet light and oxygen deprivation, according to a report from the Changjiang Daily based in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province. The research team from the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted the four experiments in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The experiments proved that algae are robust. But further experiments are also needed to learn whether the species can grow or even multiply on the surface of Mars, said Wang Gaohong, a researcher at the Institute of Hydrobiology. Algae have gradually changed and improved the environment of the Earth since the plant was born at the very beginning. Liu Yongding, director of the Chinese Society of Phycology, believes that algae were crucial for the origin and evolution of species on Earth. Algae are primary producers of the earth's biosphere, accounting for 30 percent to 40 percent of all life, and playing an important role in maintaining biosphere stability. The conditions on Mars are very similar to those on early Earth, Liu said. And algae might be useful for human exploration of the red planet. Xiao Long, a professor with the China University of Geosciences, said it is necessary to test the effects of intense radiation from outer space on algae since the experiments will be crucial for taking algae to Mars. The amount of carbon dioxide in Mars' atmosphere is several times that of Earth, said Xiao. Algae consume carbon dioxide and produce oxygen that makes life possible for other species.

The impact event is believed to be related to carbonaceous chondrites, a water-rich class of asteroids, according to Liu Yang from the National Space Science Center (NSSC) under the CAS in an exclusive interview with Xinhua. Liu was a corresponding author of the study. Yutu-2, the rover of the Chang'e-4 probe, encountered a small impact crater with a depth of 15 to 20 centimeters, and took detailed spectral measurements during the mission's ninth lunar day. After analyzing the high-resolution remote sensing images and the hyperspectral data from Yutu-2, researchers identified the materials around the center of the crater as remnants of an impact caused by carbonaceous chondrites. Previous studies have found carbonaceous chondrite fragments in lunar samples brought back by the Apollo program, but this is the first time carbonaceous chondrite impact remnants have been directly observed on the lunar surface by remote sensing, Liu said. Carbonaceous chondrites are thought to be among the oldest objects in the solar system and are rich in water and organic matter. Scientists believe that they are probably related to the origin of life on Earth. If a carbonaceous chondrite hits the moon, some of the water it was carrying could be retained on the moon, according to Liu. Previous study has shown that impacts are one of the main sources of water on the moon, along with volcanic eruptions and solar wind. The research team estimated that the impact event happened up to 1 million years ago -- a short time compared to the moon's geological time scale since its formation and roughly equivalent to a few minutes ago in a person's lifetime. The team thus concluded that carbonaceous chondrite impacts are still providing water to the moon. The study was published in the journal Nature Astronomy. Liu's team is also using data from China's Mars probe Tianwen-1 to study the ancient water environment of the red planet, he said. (Web editor: Xia Peiyao, Liang Jun)\n",

(Xinhua/Yang Guanyu) BEIJING, Dec. 28 (Xinhua) -- For Chinese scientists and engineers, the past 12 months have been a year like no other. With the pandemic still raging, scientific and technological self-reliance took center stage, bringing in advances in frontiers like space exploration, quantum science, and the battle against COVID-19. At the Beijing Aerospace Control Center this year, Zhang Rongqiao and Sun Jun were no strangers to the \"big red screen.\" The giant display turns red when a mission is declared a success. On May 15, Zhang Rongqiao, chief designer of China's first Mars exploration mission, wiped tears from his eyes as Mars probe Tianwen-1 landed safely on the red planet. It was the country's first successful Mars mission and a giant leap for deep space exploration. Zhang Rongqiao (R), chief designer of China's first Mars exploration mission, talks with Wu Weiren (2nd L), chief designer of China's lunar exploration project, at the Beijing Aerospace Control Center, after China's first Mars rover, Zhurong, drives down from its landing platform to the Martian surface, May 22, 2021. (Xinhua/Jin Liwang) Launched on July 23, 2020, Tianwen-1 arrived at Mars in February and landed the lander and rover in May. Since then, the rover Zhurong has traveled more than 1,200 meters on the planet and is currently heading toward a region that might have been the coastline of an ancient ocean, looking for clues about Mars' evolution. Earlier this month, Zhang was included on Nature's list of 10 people who were part of big stories in science in 2021. He said the landing gave him a taste of the old Chinese saying, \"it takes 10 years to sharpen a good sword.\" Sun Jun understands exactly what Zhang means by the old Chinese saying.

This year, Sun and his colleagues witnessed \"big red screen\" moments multiple times: the launch of the space station core module Tianhe, two launches of the cargo freighters Tianzhou-2 and Tianzhou-3, two crewed flights of Shenzhou-12 and Shenzhou-13, the safe return to Earth of the Shenzhou-12 crew, four extravehicular activities and a live class from the space station. \"Now we can say that we can safely and freely build, control, operate, and maintain the space station,\" Sun told reporters this month. Like space research and engineering, quantum research also continued to gain momentum this year. The quantum research team from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) again hit the highlight list of the year. Last year, China's quantum computer, Jiuzhang, performed a calculation in 200 seconds that would take a supercomputer 2.5 billion years to complete. Critics say it's unclear whether the problem a U.S. quantum computer solved was indeed beyond the capabilities of a conventional machine, and Jiuzhang is not easily reprogrammable to solve more than one problem. In an interview with Outlook Weekly under Xinhua, Chinese quantum physicist Pan Jianwei said it took the team 20 years to make the breakthrough of Jiuzhang in 2020. They achieved a series of innovations on concepts and technologies this year, and Jiuzhang 2.0 arrived to address various issues.

Snow cover is closely connected with climate. On the one hand, owing to snow's unique high albedo, it can greatly affect surface radiation and thereby climate systems. On the other hand, changes in climate in turn affect global and regional snow cover, according to the research article published in the journal Earth System Science Data. The snow cover dataset has a spatial resolution of 5 km and a daily temporal resolution. Analysis based on snow cover data on the ground and high-resolution remote sensing images showed that the overall accuracy of the dataset reached 86.1 percent, higher than that of currently existing advanced super high-resolution radiometer products. The dataset, generated by researchers from the Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou Jiaotong University and Jilin Jianzhu University, has been available online through the National Cryosphere Desert Data Center and will provide support for analyzing the spatial-temporal distribution of snow cover and its impact on hydroclimatic ecology.

These four fields are materials science, chemistry, engineering technology and computer science, with computer science being added to the list this year, the reports said. China also holds second place in 10 other fields, including agricultural science, biology and biochemistry, and environmental and ecological sciences. The data for the reports was collected from global scientific literature databases including the Science Citation Index, Scopus and Ei Compendex. Academic citation is one of the key indicators of a paper's quality and influence, and a country's total number of citations in a scientific field is commonly seen as a reflection of its overall research capability in that discipline. Last year, China published 1,833 research papers and articles in 15 of the world's top scientific publications, including Nature, Science and Cell. This feat placed China two spots higher on the ranking than 2019, reaching second place last year behind the United States. Zhao Zhiyun, director of the institute, said these achievements meant China's scientific literature has made noticeable progress in producing an increasing number of high-quality papers with global influence. \"We hope our reports can provide timely insights for science workers, administrators and policymakers to identify the latest trend in China's scientific literature and publication sector,\" she said. Experts said that China climbed in the global ranking partly due to Chinese scientists publishing a large quantity of papers regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as co-authoring and publishing more papers with international peers. Among them, Huang Chaolin, president of Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital, published a paper in January last year in the journal The Lancet that described the clinical features of patients infected with the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, Hubei province. It had been cited over 13,000 times as of September, Zhao said. Last year, Chinese scientists co-wrote around 144,500 scientific papers, 14,400 more than in 2019, with collaborators from 169 countries and regions. China's total number of co-authored papers had increased by 11.1 percent in 2020 compared with the previous year, with the US being China's biggest partner in scientific literature. China also published 485 megacollaboration scientific papers last year, each involving at least 100 scientists and 50 research institutions, in fields such as particle physics, astrophysics and nuclear physics. Guo Tiecheng, deputy director of the institute, said that from 2011 to October, China had published over 3.36 million international scientific papers, and these papers had been cited over 43.32 million times within that period. The US remains the world's top producer of scientific papers and has the largest number of citations. However, China's average number of citations per paper is around 12.8 within the 10-year period, which is lower than the global average of 13.6, Guo said. (Web editor: Zhong Wenxing, Liang Jun)\n",

With the pandemic still raging, scientific and technological self-reliance took center stage, bringing in advances in frontiers like space exploration, quantum science, and the battle against COVID-19. At the Beijing Aerospace Control Center this year, Zhang Rongqiao and Sun Jun were no strangers to the \"big red screen.\" The giant display turns red when a mission is declared a success. On May 15, Zhang Rongqiao, chief designer of China's first Mars exploration mission, wiped tears from his eyes as Mars probe Tianwen-1 landed safely on the red planet. It was the country's first successful Mars mission and a giant leap for deep space exploration. Launched on July 23, 2020, Tianwen-1 arrived at Mars in February and landed the lander and rover in May. Since then, the rover Zhurong has traveled more than 1,200 meters on the planet and is currently heading toward a region that might have been the coastline of an ancient ocean, looking for clues about Mars' evolution. Earlier this month, Zhang was included on Nature's list of 10 people who were part of big stories in science in 2021. He said the landing gave him a taste of the old Chinese saying, \"it takes 10 years to sharpen a good sword.\" Sun Jun understands exactly what Zhang means by the old Chinese saying. Sun, chief engineer of the space mission at the Beijing Aerospace Control Center, started with his colleagues in 1995. \"We didn't have a single line of software code or computers, never mind a ready-to-use guidebook,\" he recalled. This year, Sun and his colleagues witnessed \"big red screen\" moments multiple times: the launch of the space station core module Tianhe, two launches of the cargo freighters Tianzhou-2 and Tianzhou-3, two crewed flights of Shenzhou-12 and Shenzhou-13, the safe return to Earth of the Shenzhou-12 crew, four extravehicular activities and a live class from the space station. \"Now we can say that we can safely and freely build, control, operate, and maintain the space station,\" Sun told reporters this month. Like space research and engineering, quantum research also continued to gain momentum this year. The quantum research team from the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) again hit the highlight list of the year. Last year, China's quantum computer, Jiuzhang, performed a calculation in 200 seconds that would take a supercomputer 2.5 billion years to complete. Critics say it's unclear whether the problem a U.S. quantum computer solved was indeed beyond the capabilities of a conventional machine, and Jiuzhang is not easily reprogrammable to solve more than one problem. In an interview with Outlook Weekly under Xinhua, Chinese quantum physicist Pan Jianwei said it took the team 20 years to make the breakthrough of Jiuzhang in 2020. They achieved a series of innovations on concepts and technologies this year, and Jiuzhang 2.0 arrived to address various issues. In the 2021 \"Highlights of the Year\" story, the American Physical Society said \"the USTC results stand out because they provided compelling arguments that a computer had finally achieved quantum primacy,\" a quantum system's ability to outperform the best possible classical computer in a given task. \"The researchers observed exceptional quantum computational speedups that made the claim of quantum primacy hard to dispute.\" As space and quantum researchers reap the rewards from years of dedication, Chinese vaccine producers and drug developers have earned plaudits from racing against the clock to fight COVID-19.

Launched onboard Arianespace's Ariane 5 rocket at 7:20 a.m. Eastern Standard Time (1220 GMT), Webb will travel to an orbit about 1.6 million km away from Earth and undergo six months of commissioning in space -- unfolding its mirrors, sunshield, and other smaller systems; cooling down; aligning; and calibrating, according to NASA. Ground teams began receiving telemetry data from Webb about five minutes after launch. The Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket performed as expected, separating from the observatory 27 minutes into the flight. Approximately 30 minutes after launch, Webb unfolded its solar array, and mission managers confirmed that the solar array was providing power to the observatory. After solar array deployment, mission operators will establish a communications link with the observatory via the Malindi ground station in Kenya, and ground control at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore will send the first commands to the spacecraft. Engineers and ground controllers will conduct the first of three mid-course correction burns about 12 hours and 30 minutes after launch, firing Webb's thrusters to maneuver the spacecraft on an optimal trajectory toward its destination in orbit about 1 million miles from Earth, according to NASA. Webb is NASA's largest and most powerful space science telescope ever constructed. With a 6.5-meter primary mirror, the large infrared telescope will study every phase of cosmic history -- from within the solar system to the most distant observable galaxies in the early universe, said NASA. Webb will directly observe a part of space and time never seen before. It will gaze into the epoch when the very first stars and galaxies formed over 13.5 billion years ago, according to NASA. The space telescope will also be a powerful tool for studying the nearby universe, said NASA. Scientists will use Webb to study planets and other bodies in the solar system to determine their origin and evolution and compare them with exoplanets, planets that orbit other stars. \"The James Webb Space Telescope represents the ambition that NASA and our partners maintain to propel us forward into the future,\" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. \"The promise of Webb is not what we know we will discover; it's what we don't yet understand or can't yet fathom about our universe,\" he said. \"Now we will watch Webb's highly anticipated and critical 29 days on the edge. When the spacecraft unfurls in space, Webb will undergo the most difficult and complex deployment sequence ever attempted in space. Once commissioning is complete, we will see awe-inspiring images that will capture our imagination,\" said Gregory L. Robinson, Webb's program director at NASA headquarters. Webb is an international program led by NASA with the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency. (Web editor: Zhang Wenjie, Bianji)\n",

For Tang, it was his first-ever mission to space. How was the trip and what impressions has it left on him? Let’s check out what the space rookie said in a recent interview with People’s Daily. “I remember I had a dream the other night before we returned home. In that dream I went back to Earth and reunited with my family. I wanted to show them some space stunts but only found that I had already lost my ‘superpowers’ as my feet immediately touched the ground after I did a somersault. I suddenly felt a little sad,” Tang said, two months after he returned. Chinese astronauts Nie Haisheng (C), Liu Boming (R) and Tang Hongbo for the Shenzhou-12 mission meet the press at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China, June 16, 2021. (Photo by Weng Qiyu/People’s Daily Online) Back to 9:22 a.m. June 17, Tang was sitting tight in the Shenzhou-12 spaceship at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China, waiting for his trip to start as the countdown began. The rocket lifted off, with brilliant red-orange flames coming out of its boosters. Nie and Liu specifically left the seat near the porthole to Tang. After the rocket entered space, Tang eagerly opened the porthole and was immediately shocked by the splendid scenery outside. In the vast and tranquil space, the planet Earth is glowing with a blueish light, presenting serenity and magnificence. This deeply fascinated Tang, who went to space for the first time in his life. About 6.5 hours later, the spaceship was docked with the core module Tianhe. Nie opened the hatch and the three crew members “floated” into their new “home” as the first dwellers of it. They had to immediately start setting up the space station even though they had been working for 16 hours. However, as a newcomer to space, Tang didn’t adapt to the environment in space as fast as the other two astronauts did. At first, he was enjoying his “swimming” in the space station, but later his excitement turned into dizziness that made him sick. He had to stop working and rest in his “bedroom.” A photo of the Atlantic Ocean taken by Tang Hongbo from space. (Photo from the official public account of China Manned Space on WeChat) The space station had a rich “bill of fare.” Scientific staff had prepared over 120 kinds of staple food, subsidiary food, instant food, drinks, functional food and seasoning, and the menu was shifted on a weekly basis. The high efficiency sterilization technology has significantly improved the quality and taste of subsidiary dishes, and both the variety and taste of the food were enriched. Yogurt was the only food in the space station that needed to be made fresh. It was made of a mixture of prefabricated yogurt and water after being heated for five hours. The recipes were designed to make astronauts healthy and help them better complete their missions, with consideration to the astronauts’ personal preferences. Tang is from Hunan, a province known for its spicy food. He likes to cover his rice with chili sauce. Nie likes braised pork steak and rice cake, and Liu is a fan of rice cake with brown sugar. The three of them all love zongzi, a traditional Chinese rice dish made of glutinous rice stuffed with different fillings and wrapped in bamboo leaves. Tang said the first extravehicular activity has left him an unforgettable memory. He told People’s Daily that he thought he would be scared by the deep universe. However, he didn’t feel nervous at all after stepping out of the cabin. Photo of a bedroom in China’s space station taken by Tang Hongbo. (Photo from the official public account of China Manned Space on WeChat) The man had gone through hundreds of hours of training in extravehicular activities, so he was pretty adept at the operations wearing the new-generation extravehicular suit. It took him only 10 minutes to get into the cabin from outside during an extravehicular emergency drill, which was even faster than his record achieved on the ground. When Tang looked around in space, he felt the universe was as shocking as what he had seen in sci-fi movies, with shining stars sparkling in the dark. He said he missed his life on Earth when he was in space, too. He missed how his feet would touch the ground, as well as his family and friends. As long as he had spare time, he would sit beside the window staring at the Earth. Big white clouds were floating above the blue ocean in the daytime, and he also saw golden deserts, white snow mountains, green grasslands and brown mountains.

The research, published on Thursday in the journal Nature, focused on a new member of methanogenic archaebacteria family, Ca. Methanoliparum, which can directly turn long-chain alkanes in crude oil into methane in oxygen-free environment. Methanogenic archaebacteria are a group of the earliest microorganisms on earth and play a key role in biogas fermentation. Previous studies found that the fermentation needs both hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria and methanogenic archaebacteria to complete the organic degradation and methane production. The research team from the Biogas Institute of China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs found Ca. Methanoliparum in an oil reservoir. It can directly oxidate long-chain alkanes and produce methane without hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria. In traditional recovery process, the crude oil deep underground is driven by the pressure of water or chemicals. More than half of the deposits are difficult to recover and stay underground. Based on this research, the crude oil could be degraded into methane before the mixed recovery of oil and gas with higher recovery efficiency. The depleted oil field could also extend its exploitation life. The institute carried out the research with Shenzhen University, Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology of Germany, and SINOPEC Key Laboratory of Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery.

The study, published Thursday in the journal Science Translational Medicine, talks about a crystalline amino acid called glutamine, which can increase the influx and efficacy of a variety of antibiotics against pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. Scientists from Sun Yat-sen University found that glutamine was repressed in uropathogenic E. coli which can resist multiple antibiotics. However, a mouse model test showed that glutamine disarmed bacteria by making their membrane more permeable, thus stimulating the influx of antibiotics into the germ cells. Researchers found glutamine strengthened the killing ability of four types of commonly used antibiotics. They also found that glutamine can facilitate the production of nucleosides which in turn reduce antibiotic resistance. The World Health Organization declared antimicrobial resistance one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity. The findings lend a clue to the development of effective approaches for preventing chronic, multidrug-resistant bacterial infections. (Web editor: Shi Xi, Liang Jun)\n",

The study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature Chemical Biology, saw the researchers combine two kinds of engineering bacteria in specific proportions to make a hydrosol-like fabric. Researchers from the Shenzhen institutes of advanced technology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences anchored an antigen fragment to the membrane of one bacterium, and an antibody fragment to the other. The antigen and antibody fragments can adhere to each other, allowing the fabric to self-heal quickly when it is torn, according to the study.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) released a plan on Dec. 3 for the green development of its industrial sectors during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025), a step forward in the country's pursuit of low-carbon growth. The plan urges traditional sectors, such as petrochemistry, iron and steel, and non-ferrous metals, to carry out low-carbon upgrades and transform into greener industries. Meanwhile, the annual Central Economic Work Conference this December pledged to strengthen the clean and efficient use of coal. So far as the chemical industry as concerned, greener practices are getting a boost from the latest breakthroughs in chemical synthesis technology. This means that sub-industries such as fuel chemicals, inorganic chemicals and organic chemicals are becoming more environmentally friendly, with knock-on benefits across a wide range of sectors. SCI-TECH BREAKTHROUGH In 2021, Chinese researchers achieved several breakthroughs in chemical synthesis. These include a method of synthesizing starch from carbon dioxide, the first process of its kind globally, and a protein production method using industrial exhaust gas that contains carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and ammonia water. The progress in 2021 also includes converting carbon dioxide and water into pure formic acid, turning biopolyols into carbon monoxide at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and producing ethylene by hydrogenation of acetylene under mild conditions. At a ceremony in Beijing in November to honor China's distinguished scientists, engineers and research achievements, over 10 projects related to the petrochemical and coal chemical industries received awards. They included catalytic-cracking processing technology, the efficient exploitation of coalbed methane and rock oil, and crude-oil recovery. Among them, the project of nano-confined catalysis won first prize in the State Natural Science Awards. This project realized the direct and efficient synthesis of light olefins and high-value chemicals such as ethylene, propylene and butene from coal-synthesized gas, with less water and energy consumption and lower carbon emissions. Those achievements, ranging from laboratory experiment to industrial production, mean that basic materials for the chemical industry, such as ethylene, carbon monoxide, starch and protein, can be produced in a much greener way than traditional methods and with lower energy consumption and emissions. HIGHER EFFICIENCY The MIIT plan encourages the petrochemistry industry, a branch of the fuel chemical industry, to focus on direct production from crude oil and the use of coal-synthesized gas. China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation (Sinopec), China's largest oil refiner, announced in November its success in the industrial application of crude oil steam-cracking technology, which can directly turn crude oil into ethylene and propylene by skipping the traditional refining procedure. The traditional refining process can turn about 30 percent of crude oil into chemical products. Using the new technology, 1 million tonnes of crude oil can produce about 500,000 tonnes of various chemicals, including about 400,000 tonnes of high-value products such as ethylene, propylene, light aromatics and hydrogen. The crude oil catalytic-cracking technology, another technical route that Sinopec realized earlier this year, can also turn about 50 percent of crude oil into various chemicals. The combination of the two cracking technologies is expected to raise the turning rate to 70 percent. China produced about 21.6 million tonnes of ethylene in 2020, with a growth rate of 5.25 percent year-on-year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Considering the scale of production, Sinopec's new method has the potential to save a huge amount of crude oil. LOWER EMISSIONS Supported by advanced technology, chemical plants in China have started to cut their carbon emissions. In Shanghai in east China, there is already a refinery that produces carbon-neutral products. This September, the Shanghai Environment and Energy Exchange issued the country's first carbon-neutral petroleum certificate to a batch of refinery products made by Gaoqiao Petrochemical, a Sinopec subsidiary in Shanghai. Those refinery products, made from 30,000 tonnes of crude oil, include gasoline, diesel, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas that are all carbon-neutral. Between 2018 and 2020, Gaoqiao Petrochemical completed 53 pollution control projects, significantly reducing the total emissions of major pollutants during production. The average emission concentration dropped to about 23 percent of the sector's standard limit. This year, the company started projects such as colored smoke treatment, volatile organic compounds treatment, and ultra-low emission modification of heating furnaces to further cut emissions. Besides emission-control measures, Gaoqiao Petrochemical is turning byproducts into clean energy. In 2020, the company built a demonstration project to produce high purity hydrogen for fuel-cell vehicles from the byproducts of the refining plant. It plans to expand the hydrogen production line to provide 10 tonnes of hydrogen per day, enough to power 1,000 domestic fuel-cell cars to run 1,000 km. (Web editor: Shi Xi, Liang Jun)\n",

BDS has become a global constellation in stable operation. By now, 45 in-orbit BDS satellites are operational and in good mechanical health, ensuring the sustainable development of the industrial chain, said the CSNO. China has developed a complete BDS industrial chain with innovative breakthroughs in basic BDS products such as the basic chips, modules, boards and antennas, and leapfrog development in performance and large-scale application. China officially commissioned BDS on July 31, 2020, opening the new BDS-3 system to global users. China-developed BDS is now operating alongside three other systems: GPS of the United States; Galileo of the European Union; and GLONASS of Russia. The BDS can provide diverse services and powerful functions. Globally, the system can provide services of positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), global message communication, and international search and rescue. In the Asia-Pacific region, its services include regional short message communication, precise point positioning, satellite-based augmentation, and ground-based augmentation. In 2020, the total output value of China's satellite navigation and positioning services industry reached 403.3 billion yuan (about 63.3 billion U.S. dollars), up 16.9 percent compared with the volume in 2019. Since the completion and commissioning of BDS, innovative BDS-based applications have been integrated into industries and mass consumer markets, serving diverse fields including telecommunication, transport, civil aviation, disaster relief and mitigation, agriculture, and forestry. The application of the BDS ground-based augmentation system in smartphones can enable one meter-level positioning accuracy. Nearly 80 percent of smartphones put into use in the first half of 2021 in China supported the BDS. BDS is empowering transportation by playing roles in reducing the incidence of major traffic accidents and accelerating intelligent transportation. In 2020, the BDS system had been installed on more than 7 million vehicles. BDS makes agriculture more smart and efficient by saving labor costs. There are more than 45,000 units of BDS-based automatic driving systems installed on agricultural machinery across China. It is also protecting people's lives and property by providing real-time dynamic data for decision-making. In fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic, BDS has played a role in personnel movement control, infrastructure construction, and supplies distribution by unmanned vehicles.

The embryo fossil was discovered in rocks in east China around the year 2000 and housed in the Yingliang Stone Nature History Museum in Fujian Province, where it was dubbed \"Baby Yingliang\". Estimated to be 27 cm long from head to tail, the creature lies inside a 17-cm-long egg. Paleontologists believe it belongs to a toothless theropod dinosaur, or oviraptorosaur, dating back 72 to 66 million years, within the Cretaceous Period. The posture of the embryo within the egg implies that these dinosaurs developed bird-like postures close to hatching, according to the study published in the journal iScience on Wednesday. Scientists from China, Britain and Canada who worked on the study found the posture of \"Baby Yingliang\" unique among known dinosaur embryos -- its head lies below the body, with the feet on either side and the back curled along the blunt end of the egg. Previously unrecognized in dinosaurs, this posture is similar to that of modern bird embryos. Before hatching, birds are known to develop a series of tucking postures, bending their body and extending their head under their wings. Embryos that fail to attain such postures have a higher chance of death due to unsuccessful hatching. By comparing \"Baby Yingliang\" with the embryos of other dinosaurs and birds, the research team proposed that such pre-hatching behavior, which was previously thought unique to birds, evolved in theropod dinosaurs tens or hundreds of millions of years ago. Fion Waisum Ma, joint first author and PhD researcher at the University of Birmingham, said the dinosaur embryo study could help bolster people's understanding of dinosaur growth and reproduction. \"It is interesting to see this dinosaur embryo and a chicken embryo pose in a similar way inside the egg, which possibly indicates similar prehatching behaviors,\" Ma added. Steve Brusatte from the University of Edinburgh, who is part of the research team, said this little prenatal dinosaur looks just like a baby bird curled up in its egg, providing yet \"more evidence that many features of today's birds first evolved in their dinosaur ancestors.\" Dinosaur embryos are some of the rarest fossils. To further test the hypothesis raised in the study, more embryo fossil discoveries are needed, said co-author Xing Lida, professor at the China University of Geosciences.

The baby was diagnosed with Denys-drash syndrome, a fatal disease with fewer than 500 cases reported worldwide. The baby's symptoms had worsened in November, but he was not eligible for a transplant at the time. Finally, local pediatricians in southwest China's Sichuan Province applied to the national transplant ethics commission and obtained special permission for the transplant. This is part of China's intensified efforts to rescue about 20 million patients with rare diseases in the country. More than 200,000 people in China are diagnosed with such diseases every year, often struggling due to limited treatment methods and sky-high medical expenses. To speed up drug approvals, the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) is designating rare disease medicines with a priority review. More than 60 rare-disease drugs have been approved for marketing in China, according to official data. The country's national drug regulator has pledged to greenlight rare disease medicines -- with urgent clinical needs -- available in the overseas market but have not yet been marketed in China within 70 days. Among the 81 overseas drugs with urgent clinical needs listed by NMPA, more than half are for rare diseases, and 26 of them have already been approved for use, said Chen Shifei, deputy head of NMPA. Recently, a tear-jerking video showing how a national health insurance negotiator helped cut down the bidding price of Spinraza from over 53,680 yuan (8,422 U.S. dollars) per dose to 33,000 yuan went viral online and was lauded by netizens. Spinraza, a medicine for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), was once priced at a whopping 700,000 yuan. In the video, a female negotiator is seen fervently persuading to get a lesser price for the medication. \"Have you given your best?\" \"Already tried your utmost?\" \"I hope you can do more!\" -- she said repeatedly. Maomao, a three-year-old SMA patient in east China's Jiangxi Province, will be benefiting from this deal. \"It took just two years for the medicine to be included in the reimbursement list since it was approved,\" said Maomao's mother. \"It's a miracle.\" At a two-day conference on rare diseases that concluded on Dec. 19, Li Tao, deputy head of the National Healthcare Security Administration, said that seven rare-disease medicines were included in the country's medicare reimbursement list in 2021, with an average price reduction of 65 percent. Currently, more than 40 rare disease medicines are eligible for reimbursement, remarkably reducing the medical expenses for patients. China is also striving to improve the diagnosis and treatment of rare diseases. More than 500 collaborative research works on rare diseases are underway in the country's national key labs and translational medicine centers. Speaking at the conference, Zhang Shuyang, president of Peking Union Medical Hospital, said China's clinical research on rare diseases has been updated into a collaborative innovation system, achieving multiple breakthroughs in genetic mechanism, diagnostic markers, clinical typing and pathogenesis. A total of 600,000 rare disease patients have been registered in two national databases, providing researchers and clinicians with urgently needed epidemiological data, Zhang noted. Patients like Xuanxuan and Maomao are likely to have a challenging future but they can certainly expect all needed support. \"Xuanxuan has gone over the hump, the most difficult one,\" said Mao Yu, a pediatrician at the Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, adding that despite all the challenges, they will do their best to save every life.

Many Chinese researchers are now engaged in the carbon emission-related studies. On Dec. 3, Lanzhou University, based in northwest China's Gansu Province, jointly established an institute with LONGi Green Energy Technology Co., Ltd. to build a research and development platform of clean energy technology, equipment and material. Gansu, with broad Gobi and desert areas, has abundant wind, light and heat resources which can be efficiently utilized to better serve the country's carbon reduction goal. Previously, the researchers from Lanzhou University have made creative research in thin-film solar cells, silicon solar cells, lithium-ion batteries, water supercapacitors and photocatalytic hydrogen production. Both silicon and perovskite film material can be used in photovoltaic technology. The College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering under the university assembled efficient and stable perovskite cells. China has pledged to have carbon dioxide emissions peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, making the world's biggest cut in carbon emission intensity in the shortest time frame in history. The Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) released the China Sustainable Development Report 2020: Exploring Pathways towards Carbon Neutrality on Oct. 25, focusing on a comprehensive green and low-carbon transformation and carbon neutrality roadmap, with goals in phases declared for the country's carbon neutrality commitment. \"As researchers we are fully committed to giving new impetus to sustainability and carbon management,\" said Zhao Lin, professor of Geocryology with the Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology in east China's Jiangsu Province. A research team led by Zhao recently discovered that under climate warming, the degradation of permafrost which reserves large amounts of organic carbon might increase greenhouse gas release over permafrost regions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. His team has made suggestions on restricting human activities in the above-mentioned regions to better protect the permafrost and its carbon sequestration capability. In July 2021, the researchers with the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) of the CAS achieved the first global carbon flux data set and map from the country's carbon dioxide monitoring satellite TanSat, indicating that China has the capacity of spatial quantitative monitoring of global carbon budget. The TanSat was launched on Dec. 22, 2016, making China the third country after Japan and the United States to monitor greenhouse gases with its own satellite. The satellite's mission is to achieve high-precision monitoring of the global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and provide satellite data for scientific research. It is very important to establish and improve a simulation and inversion system to transform the original satellite observation information into data available for scientists. Over the years, the researchers from the IAP have developed a remote sensing inversion algorithm to accurately simulate the transmission process of solar radiation in the atmosphere, which greatly increased the accuracy of the global carbon dioxide distribution map generated from the satellite observation data. Since 2017, the data products of TanSat have been opened for global users for free. \"We hoped to cooperate with overseas counterparts to provide richer monitoring data to cope with climate change,\" said Liu Yi, a researcher with the IAP. The design and development of the new-generation carbon satellite have been put on the agenda to meet the country's carbon reduction commitment, said Liu. Peaking carbon dioxide emissions and achieving carbon neutrality will bring about a sci-tech revolution, resulting in major changes in the economy and society, which is no less important than the three previous industrial revolutions, said Chinese Minister of Science and Technology Wang Zhigang at the Xiangshan Science Conferences held in Beijing earlier this year. During an annual ceremony held on Nov. 3 in Beijing to honor distinguished scientists, engineers and research achievements, a batch of key technologies for peaking carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality, pollution control and clean-energy application were awarded, such as the biological denitrification of sewage and the advanced treatment of industrial flue gas. The minister called on Chinese researchers to create competitive advantages through sci-tech innovations to support China's low-carbon development. Science is key to ensuring the simultaneous realization of carbon neutrality and economic and social development, he said. (Web editor: Shi Xi, Liang Jun)\n",

The researchers from the University of Science and Technology of China, the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, and the Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, developed the new type of single-atom copper catalyst of high activity at a low cost to exclusively convert carbon dioxide and water into formic acid. Using the new catalyst, the researchers invented an electrolyzer to directly and continuously produce pure formic acid solutions without a product-separation process. It reduces the carbon dioxide electrolysis cost massively. Using sustainable energy sources to convert carbon dioxide into high-value chemicals is a new technology to utilize this greenhouse gas and cut carbon emissions. But the current method produces formic acid with by-products such as carbon monoxide, ethylene, and ethanol, all in the electrolytic solution at a massive cost to extract and purify. The research finding appeared in the journal Nature Nanotechnology. (Web editor: Shi Xi, Liang Jun)\n",

(Xinhua/Liu Junxi) HEFEI, Dec. 20 (Xinhua) -- China is building a research facility to incubate core technologies used in power generation of fusion energy that powers the sun. The facility in the pipeline, called \"Comprehensive Research Facility for Fusion Technology\" (CRAFT), is a platform on which engineers develop and test fusion energy reactor's key components. It is expected to be finished around 2024, according to the Institute of Plasma Physics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (ASIPP). China has already completed the engineering design of a fusion energy testing reactor, according to ASIPP. Building a fusion energy reactor is China's new scientific ambition as the country's experimental advanced superconducting tokamak (EAST) is upgrading its experiment. The EAST, based on an approach called \"magnetic confinement fusion\" that uses magnetic fields to confine fusion fuel in the form of a plasma, started a new round of experiments in early December, which will last about six months. Qian Jinping, an ASIPP researcher who manages EAST experiments, said at the control hall that the EAST discharged electricity more than 100 times per day to improve its performance. Song Yuntao, ASIPP director, told Xinhua in an exclusive interview that he and his teammates are looking forward to sustaining the high-temperature plasma for longer durations. The 400-tonne, doughnut-shaped machine, known as the \"Chinese artificial sun,\" set a world record of achieving a plasma temperature of 120 million degrees Celsius for 101 seconds in an experiment on May 28. The breakthrough is a landmark for utilizing nuclear fusion like the sun to provide a steady stream of clean energy. Fusion energy is considered a solution to Earth's energy problems. It is estimated that the deuterium in one liter of seawater can produce, through fusion reaction, the amount of energy equivalent to 300 liters of gasoline. (Web editor: Shi Xi, Liang Jun)\n",

The acceptance test of the sample machine showed that the underwater acoustic communication machine, developed by a research team from the Ocean College of Zhejiang University, realized 90 percent of transmission rate at a speed of 3.07 KBps (kiloBytes per second) over 14 km. Underwater wireless communication is an important technology to ensure the interconnection of underwater equipment. And underwater acoustic communication is a unique solution for high-speed and long-distance underwater wireless communication since electromagnetic waves are difficult to transmit through seawater. The acoustic signal at a lower frequency can be transmitted farther underwater, said Qu Fengzhong, a professor with Zhejiang University. But the bandwidth available for communication at low frequencies is very limited. Thus it is difficult for underwater acoustic communication to meet the requirements of high speeds and long distances. The relative position movement of the underwater communication transceiver causes Doppler frequencies to shift, which seriously affects the decoding of communication, according to the university. The research team led by Qu applied an anti-Doppler frequency shift underwater acoustic communication algorithm to make the machine be capable of working at high speed. The researchers also tried to design a smaller and lighter machine to make it applicable for underwater robots, submersible vehicles and underwater wireless sensor nodes.

(Photo/China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation) China’s Fengyun meteorological satellite family is providing services for users in 121 countries and regions around the world, including 85 countries and regions along the routes of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), said the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). More than 1,400 people in 92 countries and regions in the world have received training in technologies related to the meteorological satellite family, according to the CMA. Providing users at home and abroad with free access to data in real time, the Fengyun satellites have played an important role in weather forecast, natural disaster response, and ecological and environmental governance in relevant countries and regions as well as the world at large. Data released by the CMA on Dec. 13 showed that since it was put into operation in January 2019, China’s Fengyun-2H meteorological satellite, which is dubbed “the Belt and Road satellite”, has provided a total of 55,000 cloud images, with 28 full-disk cloud images and 20 images of clouds in the northern hemisphere on a daily basis. They have been widely used in weather monitoring and forecasting, disaster warning, agricultural production, scientific research and other fields in countries and regions along the routes of the BRI. After its setpoint position in space was shifted westward, the Fengyun-2H meteorological satellite has made up for the blind spots of global meteorological satellites in regions including the Indian Ocean, Central and West Asia, and Africa and been able to better serve BRI countries and regions. Its over 50,000 cloud images have been widely used in the response to natural disasters such as tropical cyclones in the Arabian Sea and floods in Sri Lanka, a vivid proof that China keeps its solemn promise to provide meteorological services to all parties with its Fengyun-2 weather satellites. Data collected by the Fengyun-2H geostationary orbit satellite, which includes images of different channels of the Fengyun-2H satellite and products like cloud top temperature and cloud classification, helps Namibia’s meteorological authority with daily weather prediction, said Vilho Ndeunyema, weatherman with Namibia Meteorological Service, at the 2021 Fengyun Satellite User Conference held last month. According to Ndeunyema, Chinese technical engineers have assisted Namibia Meteorological Service in the installation and application of Fengyun-3 Polar-orbiting Satellite Data Receiving and Processing System, which receives real-time data of Fengyun-3 satellites and other international satellites. Such data is then processed to generate relevant products in environmental monitoring services, including vegetation and lake monitoring, effectively enhancing the capability of Namibia Meteorological Service to provide environmental monitoring services, which is critical to Namibia, a country long plagued by perennial drought, said Ndeunyema. In fact, besides Fengyun-2H, all the other members of China’s Fengyun meteorological satellite family are also providing services for the weather forecast, natural disaster response, and ecological and environmental governance of countries and regions along the routes of the BRI and even the entire world, which has been troubled by global warming and increasingly frequent extreme weather events. Fengyun-3E, the world’s first meteorological satellite in dawn-dusk orbit for civil service, which is still in its in-orbit testing stage, as well as China’s new-generation meteorological satellite in geostationary orbit, Fengyun-4B, both sent into space by China several months ago, have even received request for services from global users before they are officially put into operation. On June 6 and 7 this year, Sri Lanka sought assistance from China because of flooding caused by rainstorms and an oil spill from a cargo vessel, asking the latter to initiate the Emergency Support Mechanism for International Users of FengYun Meteorological Satellites in Disaster Prevention and Mitigation. It then got dedicated emergency data and monitoring and analysis report from Fengyun satellites for coping with its crises. “We initiated the mechanism for more than 20 times this year to help countries including Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Nepal respond to disasters like dam break, volcanic eruption, and heavy rainfall,” said Wang Jingsong, director-general of the National Satellite Meteorological Center under the CMA. China is trying to make its Fengyun-4A, Fengyun-3D, and Fengyun-2H meteorological satellites listed among the “satellites on duty” of the International Charter: Space and Major Disasters to integrate into the international emergency response mechanism, Wang noted. “In fact, our data services, information receiving platform, remote sensing application products and skills training are all offered to users for free. Global users and Chinese users are all treated as equals in terms of data acquisition,” said Xian Di, deputy head of the remote sensing application center of the CMA. Data collected by China’s Fengyun meteorological satellites has been used more and more in Europe and the U.S. as well as other developed countries in such fields as data assimilation, short and imminent precipitation forecast, marine monitoring as well as scientific research. In 2021, global users of Fengyun satellites made more than 2,000 orders for data services and downloaded over nine million data files, getting more than 60TB of data. China plans to send another five meteorological satellites into space during its 14th Five Year Plan period (2021-2025), and completely replace the current Fengyun meteorological satellites with the third-generation comprehensive meteorological satellite observation system by 2035. 【1】【2】【3】 (Web editor: Meng Bin, Bianji)\n",

The two back-to-back papers published on Thursday in the journal Science Translational Medicine reported a new molecular mechanism correlated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NASH), a prevalent chronic liver disease that can lead to liver cancer. An enzyme in the human body called ACC has been known to facilitate fat synthesis in liver cells. Previously, scientists have tried to design an ACC inhibitor, but it showed an unwanted effect of increasing fat in the blood, according to the study. Scientists from Wuhan University, led by medicine professor Li Hongliang, took a backward move and found that the expression of a gene named ALOX12 increased the ACC level. In another paper, the research team described a small molecule that can disable the ALOX12 protein in mice and nonhuman primate models and then hold up the release of the ACC enzyme. The study revealed that treatment with the chemical effectively slowed down the progression of the disease in animals and did not cause excessive lipid levels. Zhang Xiaojing, a co-author of two papers, told Xinhua that the findings provided proof of concept for the use of a new class of molecules as next-generation drugs for NASH treatment.

(Xinhua/Ou Dongqu) GUIYANG, Dec. 15 (Xinhua) -- Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Radio Telescope (FAST), also dubbed as the \"China Sky Eye,\" scientists have identified over 500 new pulsars since October 2017. Pulsars, or fast-spinning neutron stars, originate from the imploded cores of massive dying stars through supernova explosions. With their high density and fast rotation, they are an ideal laboratory for studying the laws of physics in extreme environments. Using FAST, scientists also detected a total of 1,652 independent bursts from a single repeating fast radio burst (FRB) source, code-named FRB121102, said Li Di, chief scientist of the telescope and a researcher with the National Astronomical Observatories under the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It is the largest set of FRB events ever detected in history, Li said, adding that these results were published in the journal Nature in October. Scientists believe it may help clarify the origins of the so-called \"mysterious signals from deep space.\" Li said they had received around 200 observation applications from 16 countries since March when FAST officially opened to the world. Located in a naturally deep and round karst depression in southwest China's Guizhou Province, FAST started formal operation in January 2020. It is believed to be the world's most sensitive radio telescope. (Web editor: Zhong Wenxing, Liang Jun)\n",

Soil seed banks, which include all viable seeds on or in the soil, represent a critical but hidden stock for potential future plant diversity on Earth. They are vital for the long-term survival of individual plant species and the diversity and dynamics of plant communities. In the dataset established by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), 15,698 records of species diversity and density for soil seed banks in natural plant communities worldwide have been compiled. Random forest models showed that absolute latitude was an important predictor for the diversity of soil seed banks. Climate and soil were the major determinants of seed bank diversity, while net primary productivity and soil characteristics were the main predictors of seed bank density, according to the research article published in the journal Nature Communications. Moreover, the global map for predicting distribution revealed clear spatial patterns for soil seed banks worldwide. The low density of soil seed banks in species-rich low latitude biomes (such as tropical rainforest areas) leads to less resilience to natural and human disturbances. The study revealed that the diversity and density of soil seed banks in high latitude frigid zones are generally higher than those in low latitude tropical zones on a global scale, said Huang Zhenying, leader of the research team with the Institute of Botany, CAS. He added that the study also provided evidence of how environmental conditions shape the distribution of soil seed banks, which enables a more accurate prediction of the resilience and vulnerabilities of plant communities and biomes under global changes.

China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) said it will issue a new regulation to clarify the supervisory responsibilities of national and local departments, along with the requirements for battery recycling, according to Science and Technology Daily. The latest data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers showed that the cumulative NEV sales volume in China in the first 11 months this year is close to 3 million, accounting for 12.7 percent of China's total vehicle sales volume. The service life of lithium batteries, which account for the majority in NEVs, is from five to eight years, while the effective life is four to six years. The growth of NEV sales over the years has been accompanied by an increase in the number of batteries in need of recycling. In 2020, about 200,000 tonnes of batteries will be decommissioned in China, and in 2025 the figure will be 780,000 tonnes, according to the China Automotive Technology Research Center. The proper recycling of batteries on such a large scale will greatly reduce the negative impact on the environment, while saving a lot of resources. This can be accomplished by extracting the remaining metals and by echelon utilization, which involves a process of inspection, classification, disassembly, battery repair or reorganization into echelon products that can then be applied to other fields. After a new-energy vehicle battery is decommissioned, there is generally 70 percent to 80 percent of the capacity remaining, and this can be used in scenarios such as energy storage and power backup to maximize the use of the remaining energy. Batteries that do not undergo echelon utilization can be disassembled and crushed for the extraction of the remaining valuable metals, such as nickel, cobalt and lithium, which can be reused for new battery production. Recent technological progress has made the extraction of metals safer and more environmentally friendly. For example, a waste utilization and pollution control technology for lithium batteries can cut wastewater emission by more than 40 percent. This technology, invented by the Institute of Process Engineering, affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences, accomplishes the selective recovery of lithium and the treatment of wastewater that contains heavy metals, ammonia and nitrogen, providing support for the clean utilization of lithium batteries. In 2020, the process won first prize in an environmental protection award from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE). A pilot project using this technology has been built to demonstrate how to recycle lithium batteries in an environmentally-friendly way. According to the Institute of Process Engineering, the production and recycling of lithium batteries creates valuable metals as well as toxic substances such as organic solvents and compounds. Scientists are working on devising safe, efficient and green ways to recycle such materials. A regulation jointly issued by the MIIT, MEE, Ministry of Science and Technology and other ministries in August encourages closer cooperation and information sharing between echelon utilization enterprises, NEV manufacturers, battery manufacturers and scrap automobile recycling companies. The regulation also encourages battery manufacturers to participate in the echelon utilization of decommissioned batteries. By the end of October this year, some 171 enterprises had set up over 10,000 battery recycling service outlets across China. (Web editor: Shi Xi, Liang Jun)\n",

Both the figures are the highest in the world. The submersible has just recently returned to a port in the city of Sanya, south China's Hainan province from a 53-day expedition, carried by the scientific research ship Tansuo-1. It marked that the submersible has completed its second stage of sea trials of 2021. During this expedition, which was joined by over 60 researchers from 10 organizations, Fendouzhe finished 23 dives, six of which exceeded a depth of 10,000 meters. It has successfully landed on the Challenger Deep, the deepest known point of the seabed at the southern end of the Mariana Trench. Photo shows the manned submersible Fendouzhe. (Photo courtesy of China State Shipbuilding Corporation Limited) The Challenger Deep has a depth of more than 10,900 meters at its deepest point. As a key channel in the deep sea and a mysterious region that sees active geological activities, it is considered one of the frontiers of marine science. During the second stage of sea trials, a series of deep-sea instruments were tested in a depth of over 10,000 meters, including full-ocean depth autonomous underwater vehicle Wukong and an acoustic release transponder. Besides, as a submersible that is able to dive deep and work with a high precision, Fendouzhe obtained a batch of valuable samples, including water, sediment, rocks and micro-organisms. It has accumulated valuable data for use in comparative studies of environments, geological structures and life forms in different trenches. It is worth mentioning that after the expedition, the 67-year-old scientist Wang Jian became the first man in China that has joined surveys to the North and South Poles, topped the Qomolangma and dived into the waters over 10,000 below the sea surface. He is also the oldest person in the world with such an accomplishment. During the second stage of sea trials, the Mariana Consensus was initiated by participating scientists, which calls for the establishment of a standardized system for deep-sea expeditions to realize the long-term preservation and sharing of deep-sea scientific samples and data. The Consensus adopts a volunteer cooperation and sample sharing mechanism. A woman takes her child to watch a model of the manned submersible Fendouzhe exhibited at the China Science and Technology Museum, Feb. 6, 2021.

The project will invite experts and scholars from both China and abroad, so as to tackle major scientific issues together, such as the origins of life and environmental adaptation, biodiversity and climate change, among others. In recent years, China has actively launched international cooperation on manned deep-sea exploration. Ye Cong, chief designer of Fendouzhe said the Chinese submersible will be open to global scientists under certain rules. China hopes to further enhance mankind's understanding of the deep ocean through relevant science plans and international cooperation. Chen Chuanxu, chief scientist of the second stage of sea trials, introduced that Fendouzhe completed 51 dives this year, and three of them were made in five days. These dives have made the launching and retrieval of the submersible adaptable to a wider scope of sea state, and trained more oceanauts, which has made it possible for Fendouzhe to carry more scientists across the world to the deepest areas of the world.

As the live scene on the screen shifted from the space station orbiting the blue Earth to the roomy and uncluttered core module of the space station, a spinning yellow top appeared on the screen, which was followed by an introduction to the lecture made by Wang. “There is no end for space exploration. As the top spins continuously, we have moved from the Shenzhou-10 mission to the construction of China’s space station. Welcome to the ‘Tiangong Class’,” said Wang, greeting students attending the class in different cities of the country. She then introduced to students her crewmates, Zhai and Ye, who also said hello to the whole class. Wang gave students a virtual tour of the brightly lit core module of the Tiangong space station.

Blood in the lower part of our body flows upward, so we look a little chubby and puffy. It can affect our health. Therefore we need to counter the physiological effects of weightlessness through a lot of exercise methods,” Wang said. She showed students how to use treadmill and spin bike in space. In the kitchen of the core module, which is equipped with devices like microwave, water dispenser and refrigerator, Wang took out a fresh apple from the refrigerator. The water dispenser is used to draw water for drinking and cooking, according to Wang, who said that with technological advances, the space station has realized regeneration of water for drinking and cooking and that every drop of water is made full use of in the space station. Ye and Zhai demonstrated to students how they resist the physiological effects of weightlessness in space during the class.

(Xinhua/Guo Cheng) BEIJING, Dec. 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) program that is quick-minded and on par with professional human players in heads-up no-limit Texas hold'em poker. The AI program called AlphaHoldem equaled four sophisticated human players in a 10,000-hand two-player competition, after three days of self-training, according to a paper to be presented at AAAI 2022, a global AI conference to be held in Vancouver in February next year. Texas hold'em is a popular poker game in which players often deceive and bluff. It is more similar to real-world problems than go and chess since decisions are made with imperfect information. The researchers from the Institute of Automation under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) reported that AlphaHoldem, a fast learner, used only about three to four milliseconds for each movement, about 1,000 times quicker than that of first-generation AI hold'em players DeepStack and Libratus. AlphaHoldem got the better of DeepStack in a 100,000-hand competition, according to the researchers. DeepStack, developed by the University of Alberta and Libratus, developed by Carnegie Mellon University, beat professional players in heads-up no-limit two-player hold'em in 2016 and 2017. The two previous AI players, based on an algorithm called counterfactual regret minimization, spent respectively three and four seconds for each movement, consuming a large amount of computing power, the researchers said. AlphaHoldem, which employs a new framework by incorporating deep-learning into a new self-play algorithm, used only eight GPUs during its training, which is ultra-lightweight compared with DeepStack's 13,000 GPUs, according to the CAS's recent news release. The researchers said looking forward, they will apply the underlying technology to other games like mahjong and bridge, fostering smarter AI. (Web editor: Zhong Wenxing, Liang Jun)\n",

The study, published on Friday in the journal Science, reported two populations of precursor human interneurons with features that do not seem to be shared with rodents. It revealed how the human brain developed diverse interneurons that render humanity's unique advanced cognitive competence, according to the study. There are two main classes of brain cells in the cerebral cortex: excitatory and inhibitory. The \"inhibitory\" interneurons deliver a neurotransmitter called GABA to inhibit the brain when it is overexcited. Their anomaly can result in autism, depression, schizophrenia or epilepsy. Researchers from the Institute of Biophysics under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing Normal University and King's College London used single-cell sequencing technology to obtain the detailed messenger RNA information of interneurons in the first to the early second trimester of human embryos. They have found that humans are born to have diverse interneurons that lay a foundation for human's rich sentiments and advanced self-recognition. Those abilities are hard-wired into a human's brain, owing to a diverse molecular regulation mechanism in the brain's ganglionic eminence where the interneurons grow, according to the study. Duan Shumin, a professor with School of Medicine of Zhejiang University, who is not affiliated with the study, said the cell lineage of interneurons in the embryonic period opened a new front for the research, diagnosis and treatment for schizophrenia and other mental illnesses.

The feat is a major leap by China into developing its autonomous vehicle industry. The trial operation area in Yizhuang, also known as E-Town, registered the first self-driving commercial trial pilot in China, the world's second largest economy. Chinese tech giant Baidu and Pony.ai were the first companies authorized to launch the pilot services. So far, they have put no more than 100 autonomous vehicles into commercial service within an area of 60 square km in Yizhuang. Relevant regulations were also issued by the city's high-level autonomous driving demonstration zone office to support the development of the emerging industry. This marks a new stage in China's autonomous driving sector from testing and demonstration to commercialization pilot, said Chen Xiaobo, deputy director of the research center for transportation economy at the National Development and Reform Commission. \"The commercial trial of self-driving vehicles is a critical phase prior to its final application, which is conducive to cultivating an innovative and competitive self-driving industrial chain and supply chain in China,\" Chen said.

(Xinhua/Peng Ziyang) NEW LIFESTYLE A passenger can hail a self-driving taxi at an assigned station through a Baidu car-hailing App, and about three minutes later, a self-driving taxi will arrive. Currently, the commercial trial -- a 2.8 km trip -- takes about 7 minutes and costs 1.46 yuan (about 23 U.S. cents). Besides Baidu's taxi-hailing service, another company Pony.ai was authorized to launch the self-driving truck which has undertaken about 16,400 tonnes of commercial freight transportation with a cumulative mileage of over 50,000 km. Pony.ai has launched the PonyPilot service in Guangzhou and Silicon Valley, providing more than 500,000 free trips. \"Robotaxi and Robotruck are two major emerging fields in self-driving industry. More and more people now believe that information technology will reform the means of transportation,\" said Wei Dong, vice president of Baidu Intelligent Driving Group. At present, the self-driving pilot service has been extended to cities nationwide. Shanghai set up 253 self-driving test roads in four demonstration zones while Wuxi City, in east China's Jiangsu Province, is scheduled to launch three self-driving buses routes. In Baoding, north China's Hebei Province, 84 crossroads are equipped with AI-powered signal control systems, saving drivers 20 percent of the time on each trip.

(Xinhua/Peng Ziyang) BRIGHT PROSPECT As the self-driving industry evolves rapidly, the Chinese government has issued regulations and policies to facilitate the development of the industry, including the strategy for the innovative development of intelligent vehicles and the new-energy vehicle development plan (2021-2035). Peng Jun, co-founder and CEO of Pony.ai, said that policy, technology, and public acceptance are key to the rapid commercialization of self-driving vehicles, which requires large-scale trials. A total of 27 provinces and cities in China have rolled out regulations on self-driving vehicles, established 16 autonomous driving demonstration zones, and opened more than 3,500 km of test roads. Meanwhile, experts pointed out that attention should be paid to the data security of self-driving networks, which requires a coordinated policy and system design to guarantee a sound development of the self-driving industry. Wei said the development of self-driving vehicles in China has entered a fast lane, which will become a safe and time-saving choice for the public. Kong Lei, director of the Beijing high-level autonomous driving demonstration zone office, said Beijing will expand the commercial trial areas in due time. Zhou Ji, member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said that the next 15 years represent a critical period in the development of intelligent manufacturing, a core technology in the new round of industrial revolution, which is also an important opportunity for China.

Chinese astronauts Nie Haisheng (middle), Liu Boming (right) and Tang Hongbo meet Chinese and foreign journalists at Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China before setting out for the country’s Shenzhou-12 spaceflight mission, June 16, 2021. (People’s Daily Online/ Weng Qiyu) At the press conference held by the China Astronaut Research and Training Center in Beijing, the three astronauts, i.e. Nie Haisheng, Liu Boming and Tang Hongbo, were in good shape and full of energy. Jing haipeng, head of the Astronaut Corps of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army, introduced the crew members’ recovery from their 90-day stay in space and their follow-up plans at the press conference. According to Jing, recovery of the crew members following their return to Earth includes three stages, specifically quarantine, recuperation and observation. So far, they have already completed the first two stages. The three astronauts are emotionally stable and in good psychological condition. Their weight is at the same level as that before the space flight, and their muscle strength, endurance, as well as motor and cardiopulmonary functions have been further restored and met expectations.

(Photo/Website of China Manned Space) Jing said the three astronauts have entered the observation stage and will resume their regular training after completing health assessment. During their stay in space, the crew members verified many key technologies for the construction and operation of China’s Tiangong space station in orbit, including technologies concerning astronauts’ long-term stay in orbit, bio-regenerative life support system, supply of space materials, and extravehicular activities (EVAs), said Nie, noting that the three-month stay in space was both long and short. Meanwhile, the astronauts completed the daily management of the combination of the Tianhe core module of the Tiangong space station and the Tianzhou-2 cargo spacecraft, conducted a large number of science and technology experiments, and performed two EVAs, accumulating a lot of valuable experience, Nie added. Nie, who has flown into space three times, said that each flight brought him something new. “The spacecraft has become roomier, more comfortable and reliable. The food we have in space is more diversified and we have gained more experience in enjoying the life in space, which couldn’t have been possible without the wisdom and hard work of aerospace scientists and researchers,” he said. According to Liu, the first astronaut in China that has completed two EVAs, though faced with many unknown challenges during the Shenzhou-12 mission, China’s first manned mission for the construction of its space station, they felt confident about finishing the tasks from the very beginning, as they had received strict, scientific, systematic, and comprehensive training before venturing into space. “After actually living and working in space, I’m more convinced that our training has been effective and comprehensive,” Liu pointed out.

(Photo/Website of China Manned Space) The most challenging part of EVAs is the preparations before actual spacewalks, Tang said, who shared his EVA during the Shenzhou-12 mission at the press conference. For one week, the crew prepared for their first EVA in collaboration with ground control to make sure that extravehicular mobility units were fully functional with no possible omissions. It was because of such careful preparations that their first EVA during the Shenzhou-12 mission, which lasted for seven hours, went smoothly and all their tasks were completed successfully. “After I stepped out of the space station, I felt like I was in a science fiction film. I will never forget the magnificent and impressive scenery in space,” he said. Tang is one of the first astronauts to enter China’s space station. “It is really big and deep. The sleeping zone is quiet and the view from the space station is amazing,” Tang said, adding that he couldn’t wait to take pictures of the spectacular scenery outside the window with his mobile phone during break. “Most importantly, the Tiangong space station is the space science experiment platform of our country. It provides precious opportunities for conducting science experiments and operations, which were fascinating and made us proud,” he said. (Web editor: Hongyu, Liang Jun)\n",
