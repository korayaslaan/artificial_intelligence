Cool.;WHEN Rich Press, a photographer, first saw a high school robotics competition, he thought, “In high school, I never came across anything like this, but if I had, it would have changed my life.” Mr. Press was impressed with the students’ brilliance, but robotics culture thrilled him. “They turn the prevailing culture  where being smart isn’t cool, where girls don’t program computers, where inner-city kids don’t get many engineering scholarships  on its head. Here, these are the coolest kids in school.” Robotics competitions are organized by a nonprofit organization called FIRST  For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology  which has its headquarters in Manchester, N.H. The competition, which began in 1989 with 28 teams, has grown to 1,300 teams nationally. With engineer mentors, teams of 10 to 20 students form in the fall to compete in local, regional and national competitions in the spring. Each team starts with an identical robot kit and a challenge. This year, the robots were required to move large balls around a track to score points. The teams invented a wide array of devices for moving the balls: tongs, pincers, grapplers, scoops, even vacuum-powered suction cups. Of the 64 teams competing in the Northeast Regionals last month at the Javits Center, New Jersey teams took all the field performance awards, but two New York City teams  the Warriors from Alfred E. Smith High School in the Bronx and the Harlem Knights of Frederick Douglass Academy and Rice High School in Manhattan  won Judge’s Awards, which recognize a team’s “unique efforts, performance, or dynamics.”Everything about these competitions is photogenic  the game, the “pit” where robots are serviced, the referees and the judges. It is Mr. Press’s team portraits, however, that best tell these students’ story. \n",
            "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/fashion/25brain.html?searchResultPosition=2;2008-05-25;fashion;A Superhighway to Bliss;JILL BOLTE TAYLOR was a neuroscientist working at Harvard’s brain research center when she experienced nirvana.But she did it by having a stroke.On Dec. 10, 1996, Dr. Taylor, then 37, woke up in her apartment near Boston with a piercing pain behind her eye. A blood vessel in her brain had popped. Within minutes, her left lobe  the source of ego, analysis, judgment and context  began to fail her. Oddly, it felt great.The incessant chatter that normally filled her mind disappeared. Her everyday worries  about a brother with schizophrenia and her high-powered job  untethered themselves from her and slid away. Her perceptions changed, too. She could see that the atoms and molecules making up her body blended with the space around her; the whole world and the creatures in it were all part of the same magnificent field of shimmering energy.“My perception of physical boundaries was no longer limited to where my skin met air,” she has written in her memoir, “My Stroke of Insight,” which was just published by Viking. After experiencing intense pain, she said, her body disconnected from her mind. “I felt like a genie liberated from its bottle,” she wrote in her book. “The energy of my spirit seemed to flow like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria.” While her spirit soared, her body struggled to live. She had a clot the size of a golf ball in her head, and without the use of her left hemisphere she lost basic analytical functions like her ability to speak, to understand numbers or letters, and even, at first, to recognize her mother. A friend took her to the hospital. Surgery and eight years of recovery followed. Her desire to teach others about nirvana, Dr. Taylor said, strongly motivated her to squeeze her spirit back into her body and to get well.This story is not typical of stroke victims. Left-brain injuries don’t necessarily lead to blissful enlightenment; people sometimes sink into a helplessly moody state: their emotions run riot. Dr. Taylor was also helped because her left hemisphere was not destroyed, and that probably explains how she was able to recover fully.  Today, she says, she is a new person, one who “can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere” on command and be “one with all that is.”To her it is not faith, but science. She brings a deep personal understanding to something she long studied: that the two lobes of the brain have very different personalities. Generally, the left brain gives us context, ego, time, logic. The right brain gives us creativity and empathy. For most English-speakers, the left brain, which processes language, is dominant. Dr. Taylor’s insight is that it doesn’t have to be so.Her message, that people can choose to live a more peaceful, spiritual life by sidestepping their left brain, has resonated widely.In February, Dr. Taylor spoke at the Technology, Entertainment, Design conference (known as TED), the annual forum for presenting innovative scientific ideas. The result was electric. After her 18-minute address was posted as a video on TED’s Web site, she become a mini-celebrity. More than two million viewers have watched her talk, and about 20,000 more a day continue to do so. An interview with her was also posted on Oprah Winfrey’s Web site, and she was chosen as one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world for 2008. She also receives more than 100 e-mail messages a day from fans. Some are brain scientists, who are fascinated that one of their own has had a stroke and can now come back and translate the experience in terms they can use. Some are stroke victims or their caregivers who want to share their stories and thank her for her openness.But many reaching out are spiritual seekers, particularly Buddhists and meditation practitioners, who say her experience confirms their belief that there is an attainable state of joy. “People are so taken with it,” said Sharon Salzberg, a founder of the Insight Mediation Society in Barre, Mass. “I keep getting that video in e-mail. I must have 100 copies.”She is excited by Dr. Taylor’s speech because it uses the language of science to describe an occurrence that is normally ethereal. Dr. Taylor shows the less mystically inclined, she said, that this experience of deep contentment “is part of the capacity of the human mind.”Since the stroke, Dr. Taylor has moved to Bloomington, Ind., an hour from where she was raised in Terre Haute and where her mother, Gladys Gillman Taylor, who nursed her back to health, still lives.ImageDr. Taylor says\n",

            "used to foster contentment.Credit...AJ Mast for The New York TimesOriginally, Dr. Taylor became a brain scientist  she has a Ph.D. in life sciences with a specialty in neuroanatomy  because she has a mentally ill brother who suffers from delusions that he is in direct contact with Jesus. And for her old research lab at Harvard, she continues to speak on behalf of the mentally ill.But otherwise, she has dialed back her once loaded work schedule. Her house is on a leafy cul-de-sac minutes from Indiana University, which she attended as an undergraduate and where she now teaches at the medical school. Her foyer is painted a vibrant purple. She greets a stranger at the door with a warm hug. When she talks, her pale blue eyes make extended contact.Never married, she lives with her dog and two cats. She unselfconsciously calls her mother, 82, her best friend. She seems bemused but not at all put off by the hundreds who have reached out to her on a spiritual level. Religious ecstatics who claim to see angels have asked her to appear on their radio and television programs. She has declined these offers. Although her father is an Episcopal minister and she was raised in his church, she cannot be counted among the traditionally faithful. “Religion is a story that the left brain tells the right brain,” she said. Still, Dr. Taylor says, “nirvana exists right now.” “There is no doubt that it is a beautiful state and that we can get there,” she said. That belief has certainly sparked debate. On Web sites like evolvingbeings.com and in Eckhart Tolle discussion groups, people debate whether she is truly enlightened or just physically damaged and confused.Even her own scientific brethren have wondered. “When I saw her on the TED video, at first I thought, Oh my god, is she losing it,” said Dr. Francine M. Benes, director of the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center, where Dr. Taylor once worked.Dr. Benes makes clear that she still thinks Dr. Taylor is an extraordinary and competent woman. “It is just that the mystical side was not apparent when she was at Harvard,” Dr. Benes said.Dr. Taylor makes no excuses or apologies, or even explanations. She says instead that she continues to battle her left brain for the better. She gently offers tips on how it might be done. “As the child of divorced parents and a mentally ill brother, I was angry,” she said. Now when she feels anger rising, she trumps it with a thought of a person or activity that brings her pleasure. No meditation necessary, she says, just the belief that the left brain can be tamed. Her newfound connection to other living beings means that she is no longer interested in performing experiments on live rat brains, which she did as a researcher. She is committed to making time for passions  physical and visual  that she believes exercise her right brain, including water-skiing, guitar playing and stained-glass making. A picture of one of her intricate stained-glass pieces  of a brain  graces the cover of her book.Karen Armstrong, a religious historian who has written several popular books including one on the Buddha, says there are odd parallels between his story and Dr. Taylor’s. “Like this lady, he was reluctant to return to this world,” she said. “He wanted to luxuriate in the sense of enlightenment.”But, she said, “the dynamic of the religious required that he go out into the world and share his sense of compassion.”And in the end, compassion is why Dr. Taylor says she wrote her memoir. She thinks there is much to be mined from her experience on how brain-trauma patients might best recover and, in fact, she hopes to open a center in Indiana to treat such patients based on those principles. And then there is the question of world peace. No, Dr. Taylor doesn’t know how to attain that, but she does think the right hemisphere could help. Or as she told the TED conference:“I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace circuitry of our right hemispheres, the more peace we will project into the world, and the more peaceful our planet will be.” It almost seems like science.\n",

She did not want a live-in helper, and she cannot drive. At 88, Mrs. Trost has macular degeneration and takes medications for seizures, memory loss and restless leg syndrome.“She’s a feisty gal,” Mrs. Pitet said of her mother. “She is fine when she takes her medicines, but, even so, I was terrified of leaving her alone.”Mrs. Pitet and her sister decided to become part of a small but growing number of people who have installed motion sensors and a remote monitoring system to keep aging relatives safe. Sensors attached to the wall are able to register when Mrs. Trost gets out of bed and whether she stops at her medication dispenser, and to alert her daughters to any deviations from her routine that might indicate an accident or illness. The family is updated by electronic report every morning. Monitoring systems like these, which go far beyond the emergency response buttons that have been around for years, are not found in many homes yet. Privacy is an issue for some older people, and the basic package can range from $50 up to $85 a month for the motion sensors and remote monitoring system like Mrs. Trost uses. More comprehensive packages can include devices to track blood pressure, weight or respiration. Experts on aging say the systems will become commonplace as the 76 million baby boomers approach ages when disabilities or conditions like diabetes and failing eyesight jeopardize the ability to live independently. The population of those 65 years and older is almost 40 million today, and the federal Census Bureau says that will more than double, to nearly 87 million, by midcentury.Right now, there is little federal health care reimbursement for such devices. And private insurance coverage is evolving because the area is new, said Dr. Jeremy Nobel, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who co-wrote a study on the feasibility of such technologies. “We are at the beginning stages regarding the availability of such services and before business models are developed,” said Dr. Nobel, a medical doctor. “I expect we’ll see a significant increase in the adoption of such systems in two to five years, and widespread adoption in 10 years.”The coming wave of aging Americans threatens to swamp the existing stock of retirement communities, assisted living and nursing home facilities  making it impossible to accommodate everyone who will need, or might want, more structured care.Experts on aging say motion sensors and other high-tech devices will help cover the shortfall, allowing older people to live independently for longer. The growing number of Alzheimer’s sufferers, which is expected to more than triple from the current four million by 2050, may also spur wider adoption of technologies like motion sensors to alert others to deviations in routine, trackers to assure medications are taken and emergency response buttons. Technology systems to underpin living independently, or what some call “aging in place,” are still years from being rolled out in a big way, awaiting adequate financing for research and other incentives, like coverage by insurance companies, according to Mr. Nobel’s study, which was released in March by the Center for Aging Services Technologies, a program of the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging. But projects are under way around the country to test high-tech gadgets for home use, including wireless sensors and devices to regulate temperature, lights and appliances, and sophisticated medical monitors. And some care providers have begun to equip clients with devices that fit their needs. NewCourtland Elder Services, a care provider for some 2,000 people in Philadelphia, started a yearlong pilot in 2006 that equipped 33 patients living on their own with remote sensors that tracked changes in their health or living patterns that required early medical intervention, said Kim Brooks, the vice president for housing and services at NewCourtland. One of the patients is Cleora Coley, 77, a retired pharmacy technician, who is in a wheelchair after losing a leg to diabetes. Two years ago, Ms. Coley moved to a living complex for the elderly because she could not maneuver the stairs in her family home. In her apartment, she checks her blood pressure with a cuff that automatically sends the reading to a monitoring center, which notifies her and her doctor of any change. Sensors placed in each room keep track of her movements, and she has a button to summon assistance, which she used in April when she fell.“I’m alone but I know I’m not all by myself,” Mrs. Coley said, adding, “And I really like my independence.” NewCourtland is starting a trial in cooperation with health insurance companies and home health agencies, installing medical monitoring devices in 1,000 residences over the next six months.One major roadblock for wider adoption of in-home monitoring has been concern that older people, unused to everyday technologies like the Internet, would resist their use. That was true for Mrs. Trost, who said she was apprehensive about having electronic gadgets around but said she had found that “they are really no bother.” A survey by AARP found that older people were willing to use high-tech devices at home, and to pay about $50 a month. The privacy issue made John T. Fowlkes, 86, of Raleigh, N.C., hesitate last year when his children wanted to install a motion sensor system. “What convinced me was that there are no cameras,” said Mr. Fowlkes, a retired postal service distribution clerk who lives by himself in an apartment building for retired people. “I get peace of mind, but no one is looking at me.” Some exploration into future technologies is being financed by the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health, which has been giving grants to entrepreneurs to develop devices like a video data collection system to analyze an elderly person’s activity level. But most research dollars have come from private companies like Intel Corporation. Intel researchers are developing devices like a “memory bracelet” that vibrates at a specified time to remind the wearer of a doctor’s appointment or to take medication. Also in trials are sensor-infused carpets  Eric Dishman, Intel’s director of product research, calls them “magic carpets”  and wearable sensors, which would measure changes in gait, to help avoid falls.Intel invested $3 million with the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology, which runs what it calls a living laboratory, with 225 volunteers. The project, which also received $7 million from the federal aging institute, uses sensors on walls, doorways and appliances  and computer games  to detect cognitive decline. “There is going to be a major transformation in health care because of these technologies,” said Dr. Jeffrey Kaye, director of the center, at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, who oversees the project. “It’s more a question of when rather than whether.” Recognizing the commercial potential of technologies for the aging, dozens of companies, including GE Healthcare, IBM and Medtronic, two years ago formed the Continua Health Alliance to develop products to aid older people. Despite the projects, trials and commercial interest, Mr. Dishman said the United States was “missing in action” in aging technologies, compared with Europe.“There just hasn’t been enough research and development yet to prove these technologies work,” he said. “None of us wants to put a bunch of technology in homes of frail elders unless it does.”He said the European Union had committed $1.5 billion to developing independent-living technologies. Last year, Intel partnered with Ireland’s government to open the Technology Research for Independent Living Center, known as Tril, in Dublin, to invent and test independent-living technologies in the households of hundreds of older people.So far, he said, a dozen other countries and 30 universities have approached Tril for advice and assistance.\n",
            "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/books/review/Dunn-t.html?searchResultPosition=5;2008-05-25;books;Partial Recall;Behind all the good-natured joking about “senior moments” lies real frustration and fear. How empowering, then, that we can do something to ward off normal, age-related memory loss: exercise. No, it’s not as easy as popping a pill. But as Sue Halpern reports in “Can’t Remember What I Forgot,” even a few brisk walks per week can have a measurable effect. Exercise promotes the birth of new neurons in the very part of the hippocampus (a brain structure crucial to forming new memories) that begins to malfunction with age. Exercise also counters age-related shrinking of the prefrontal cortex, an area involved in concentration and working memory (as in remembering a phone number long enough to dial).Of course, if you’re unwilling to exercise for your health, or even to look good in a bathing suit, perhaps you’re still hoping for an easier solution. The problem, Halpern explains, is that solid, peer-reviewed science has not yet proved that anything else works: not herbal supplements, fish oil, vitamin E, almonds, $400 interactive computer software or even crossword puzzles. (After reading her section on blueberries, however, you’ll want to buy them by the bucketful.) To cut through the hype and confusion, Halpern, whose father had dementia, set out to discover what scientists really know, and how close they are to a drug or therapy that works  either for the pathological memory loss caused by Alzheimer’s, or the “normal” kind that happens inexorably as we age. Her most interesting passages highlight the distinctions between the two. Both ravage the hippocampus; yet a different part of the hippocampus is “broken” in each condition, and different molecules have stopped doing their jobs. “To understand something to the point of being able to fix it you have to get down to the molecular level,” Scott Small, a neurologist at Columbia, tells Halpern. “And that’s where we’re at.” Yet for a book subtitled “The Good News From the Front Lines of Memory Research,” the hope it contains is markedly thin. Most of this “good news” involves new methods for the early detection of Alzheimer’s, which can offer patients only time to plan for an unavoidable fate. ImageCredit...Francesco BongiorniAs part of her research, Halpern volunteered for a host of tests that can help diagnose dementia, including a variety of brain scans. She puts her own process of discovery front and center, reporting on cutting-edge science through the story of her interactions with scientists. Halpern, a nature writer and novelist, seems most at home unfolding a scene in naturalistic detail. The richest material comes from her 2005 New Yorker article about Scott Small’s boss, Richard Mayeux, and his research team’s search for a new gene linked to late-onset Alzheimer’s. Suddenly we’re among gamblers, prostitutes and chickens in the early-morning streets of the Dominican Republic, driving to meet the families with Alzheimer’s whose blood samples will reveal the new risk-factor gene. Unfortunately, Halpern’s enviable powers of description are often squandered on details that seem off-point. For instance, she gives a blow-by-blow account of her six-hour marathon of memory testing, and of her experience lying prone in each brain scanner. She also walks us down too many blind alleys in her reporting. Consider her enthusiasm for a memory drug being developed at a secretive start-up called Sention. “I was the first writer allowed through the door,” she boasts, exhilarated, describing the history and science behind this “honest-to-God gold mine of a wonder drug” in detail. Next thing we know, Sention has gone out of business. More troublesome are some of Halpern’s sloppy descriptions of the science itself. She writes that flavanoids, celebrated for their cardiovascular health benefits, are a “class of plants” (in truth, they are chemicals found in plants) and at one point assigns “red wine” to this group. She writes that two human genes  the presenilin genes  cause early-onset Alzheimer’s, but are “carried by only a few hundred families worldwide.” (We all carry the genes; what most of us don’t carry are rare, Alzheimer’s-causing mutations in them.) Part of Halpern’s self-deprecating charm is that she is one of “us,” the general public, fretting about her lapses in memory and pushing scientists to answer our most pressing questions. But readers may sometimes wish for a more authoritative guide. When Small proposes that the “giant, complex thing called normal memory decline could be accounted for by a single molecule,” Halpern is stunned. If this “renegade idea” is correct, she suggests, Small may set off an explosive scientific revolution à la Thomas Kuhn. Well, perhaps the revolution was not adequately televised, but what Small is proposing is a now-standard idea: that changes to single molecules can radically alter brain function and behavior. (Think of SSRIs, like Prozac, for depression.) He even gives Halpern several examples, ranging from Huntington’s disease to the sexual behavior of male prairie voles. All told, Halpern sees “many reasons to cheer,” given the “smart and committed people” searching for cures. Still, her book ends with a note of disappointment. When Small announces another incremental breakthrough, Halpern can’t help thinking: “All that work in his lab and, so far, in the clinic, not a lot to show for it.” The book itself is a valuable snapshot in time. It lacks, however, a vivid, overarching narrative that would have maintained its value once the science moves on. In the current glut of books about memory, sad to say, this one is likely to be forgotten.\n",

Scaling portions of an old stone wall, now and then dunking from moss bed into mud, the Hansons and others upturned rocks, in search of at least one member of Connecticut’s dozen native salamander species.They were on a mission to tally salamanders as participants in one of a series of “citizen science” outings organized by the Mystic Aquarium and Institute for Exploration’s Amphibian Monitoring Project. The aquarium is helping in an international bid to save frogs and amphibians by identifying and counting species amid scientists’ concerns that some of them have become vulnerable in recent years.As spring progresses, the aquarium’s amphibian monitors will conduct weekly searches starting 30 minutes after sunset or later, at a chosen wetlands site. The monitoring program will eventually widen to include Connecticut’s eight species of frogs and two toad species.By the end of the hunt, Keaton Hanson, 10, had caught a four-toed salamander and his brother, Kyler, 8, had a red back specimen to show. “It’s a fun and worthy exercise for my family to get involved in a big science project at the local level,” Mr. Hanson said. “My father was a biologist. I’ve had a lifelong interest in it. I want to give my kids that exposure.”Before the hunt, MaryEllen Mateleska, an educator for the aquarium, told the volunteers that there are 5,500 frog and amphibian species worldwide.Of these, 1,500 species are reportedly in decline, and 34 species have become extinct. Of the 280 amphibian species in the United States, 38 are on the Endangered Species Act’s official list.Biologists say the causes for the United States decline include habitat loss (the prevalent cause for species endangerment in Connecticut, Ms. Mateleska said) pollutants, invasive species and parasites and diseases. FrogwatchUSA, established by the National Wildlife Federation of Reston, Va., and the United States Geological Survey, created this rendition of citizen science, in which members of the public are asked to gather localized field data, like which species are discovered where and the number of animals found at each location.While they are aiding science, volunteers are introduced to homespun projects to help preserve a species. In the aquarium’s case, for example, Ms. Mateleska provided instructions for creating “Toad Abodes”  habitats that could be made of terra cotta pots or rock piles.It was frog finding that dominated Ms. Mateleska’s training session. There are, she said, two strategies involved. The first is “kick-flip,” to bring a specimen to light, “careful flip, careful return and watchful eye.” The second strategy is to find and identify frogs by their songs: “recording the ribbit,” in FrogwatchUSA parlance. The songs can vary from the sweet jingle from a colony of tiny spring peepers to the low groans of American bullfrogs, which inhabit streams, fresh ponds and rivers throughout Connecticut. After sunset is the optimal time to hear the songs, according to FrogwatchUSA. The group asks that each outing report include conditions like air temperature, wind speed, current precipitation and a weather history of the site.Monitors will also record the time they begin listening for the songs, the time they stop listening, different species heard and  by using a specialized device  the intensity of each species’ sounds. Their findings will then go to FrogwatchUSA.After searching for salamanders, Kyler said: “I haven’t learned much about salamanders in school.”Keaton said he found unearthing the four-toed salamander exciting.\n",

It started when he and his fellow engineers released a report showing that deforestation of Brazil’s portion of the rainforest seemed to have shot up again after two years of decline.Since then, Dr. Câmara, who leads the National Institute for Space Research here, has found himself having to defend his agency’s findings against one of Brazil’s richest and most powerful men: Blairo Maggi, who is governor of the country’s largest agricultural state, Mato Grosso, and a business owner known as the “Soybean King.”Governor Maggi was exercised enough by the report  which led to harsh measures stifling business in his state  that he asked for, and was granted, a meeting with the president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The stakes could not be higher for Mr. da Silva. Stewardship of the Amazon has always been a touchy subject, with many Brazilians fearful that world powers would try to impose their standards on the rainforest. In recent years, the debate over the Amazon has intensified, with many outside the country seeing an intact rainforest as a key to controlling global warming. At the same time, Brazil’s economy has taken off  largely because of businesses that are claiming more of the Amazon’s land for crops and livestock, and more of its trees for logging.Mr. da Silva has spent the last several years  walking a careful line, trying to maintain his image as Brazil’s first “green” president, which has gained him international cachet, without threatening Brazil’s agriculture industry at a time of soaring grain and meat prices. Dr. Câmara’s findings made the president’s balancing act harder and turned up the heat on what had been a long-simmering battle between businesses and environmentalists. It did not help that the scientists’ report, released in January, relied heavily on progressive deforestation, a relatively new measure that is is widely accepted by environmentalists but that Governor Maggi contends is tantamount to lying. The space agency argues that this slower-paced deforestation, where parts of the forest are thinned out little by little rather than at once, can be just as devastating.The criticism of the report worried scientists in and out of Brazil, including Dr. Câmara. “Science,” he said, “should not bow to authority.”ImageA report produced by Gilberto Câmara, above, a scientist who leads Brazil’s national space agency, has been criticized for its heavy reliance on a relatively new measure of deforestation.Credit...Lalo de Almeida for The New York TimesThe space agency, known as INPE, reported in January that deforestation had hit an estimated 4,300 square miles between August and December of last year. If that pace continues, the yearly total for deforestation would jump; the number was approximately 6,900 square miles from August 2006 to August 2007. The agency’s data also showed that 54 percent of the deforestation had occurred in Mato Grosso, Governor Maggi’s state, where the scientists said ranchers and loggers pushed farther into the rainforest.Some of the deforestation is legal. Owners are allowed to clear 20 percent of their land in the rainforest. Nonetheless, the report was a headache for the government. Mr. da Silva has received international attention in recent years for the country’s growing biofuels program and for the recent two-year drop in deforestation. Suddenly environmentalists across the world were again criticizing Brazil’s efforts to save the rainforest.The attacks on the space agency made some environmentalists worry publicly that the president might cave in to pressure from businesses.   Environmentalists became even more alarmed when Marina Silva, Brazil’s environmental minister and a respected rainforest defender, resigned this month. While leaving, she spoke of heavy pressures being exerted by industry-minded governors, including Governor Maggi, to reverse the federal crackdown on destruction of the forest.Still, Mr. da Silva responded to the space agency’s report with tough measures, including imposing credit restrictions on those found to be involved in illegal forest-clearing and creating a Arc of Fire, a multi-agency police operation that conducts surprise raids to catch illegal loggers. The space agency has two systems for measuring deforestation. Prodes, a yearly satellite analysis, measures deforested areas as small as about 15 acres, while Deter, a lower-resolution system, maps areas greater than about 60 acres in real-time, giving law enforcement information to act quickly to stop further destruction. The dispute over the space agency’s figures has centered on the information provided by Deter. In the past, Dr. Câmara said, the agency included mostly large swaths of cleared land in its analysis. But environmental researchers have been clamoring for years for satellite researchers to expand monitoring to include areas thinned by logging and surface fires, rather than just areas that have been clear cut. The agency uses the term progressive deforestation to refer to the slower form of forest degradation that has become increasingly common in the Amazon in recent years and which Dr. Câmara said the agency began including in its analysis in 2005. The latest deforestation alerts have shown that about one-third of newly deforested areas were from progressive degradation, of which more than 75 percent were “severely degraded,” he said.“We had to ask ourselves what happened between forest and clear-cut,” said Dr. Câmara, 52, who has been with the agency for 26 years. “With a view that if you are going to do prevention and enforcement, you need to be there as rapidly as possible.”In other words, if farmers, loggers and others are clearing illegally, but slowly, the government, by identifying thinned-out areas, has a better chance to catch them before a large area has been affected. “We are satisfied with the technology we have,” Dr. Câmara said. “It is the largest use of remote sensing data for environmental protection worldwide on a systematic basis of any country.” But for Governor Maggi, who leads the state that has become a locomotive in Brazil’s surging agriculture industry, news that Mato Grosso was once again the worst deforestation offender was difficult to accept. While he is lauded by many for pioneering Brazil’s expansion into the world soybean market, his pro-industry stance and actions as head of a soybean-growing business have made him a frequent target of environmentalists. Greenpeace gave him the Golden Chainsaw Award in 2005 for being the Brazilian who most contributed to the destruction of the rainforest. Governor Maggi’s chief of staff, Alexander Torres Maia, did not respond to phone calls seeking comment, and he did not reply to a list of questions sent via e-mail last week. In recent years, critics say Governor Maggi has softened his all-out defense of the rights of businesses out of political necessity. But that did not stop his administration from challenging the satellite data. Officials in Mato Grosso said that the state’s environmental agency had never heard of progressive deforestation. “We could see this wasn’t deforestation, it was burning of fields and old deforestation,” Luis Henrique Chaves Daldegan, Mato Grosso’s environment secretary, said in an interview. Mato Grosso’s environmental agency worked to gather evidence to prove the space agency had overreached. Technicians compared satellite images dating from 2000, went to disputed locations and shot photos of what was there today. Mr. Daldegan said the pictures proved that the space agency was declaring land that had been deforested as far back as 2000 as newly cleared.On March 25, the state agency provided Dr. Câmara with a detailed report that included 854 photos of areas in Mato Grosso that the space agency had included in its tally. The state report contended that only 10 percent of the areas had recently been deforested. Dr. Câmara put 10 of the 50 specialists that had produced the deforestation analysis onto the task of analyzing Mato Grosso’s photos and data. They worked intensely for six weeks, he said, sometimes time-stamping their analysis of the photos after midnight.“There was clearly a sense of urgency,” Dr. Câmara said.In the end, the space agency said that 96 percent of its initial assessments had been correct.“INPE is very proud, and the internal pressures were almost stronger than the external pressures to show that science would win out,” Dr. Câmara said. He did, however, agree to try using higher-resolution satellites in the future to improve the reliability of his agency’s analysis. Mr. Daldegan said he is still not satisfied. “We don’t think this is the end of the story,” Dr. Câmara said. “They did not ask us to stop doing this data. So this was a step forward.”\n",

Cool.;WHEN Rich Press, a photographer, first saw a high school robotics competition, he thought, “In high school, I never came across anything like this, but if I had, it would have changed my life.” Mr. Press was impressed with the students’ brilliance, but robotics culture thrilled him. “They turn the prevailing culture  where being smart isn’t cool, where girls don’t program computers, where inner-city kids don’t get many engineering scholarships  on its head. Here, these are the coolest kids in school.” Robotics competitions are organized by a nonprofit organization called FIRST  For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology  which has its headquarters in Manchester, N.H. The competition, which began in 1989 with 28 teams, has grown to 1,300 teams nationally. With engineer mentors, teams of 10 to 20 students form in the fall to compete in local, regional and national competitions in the spring. Each team starts with an identical robot kit and a challenge. This year, the robots were required to move large balls around a track to score points. The teams invented a wide array of devices for moving the balls: tongs, pincers, grapplers, scoops, even vacuum-powered suction cups. Of the 64 teams competing in the Northeast Regionals last month at the Javits Center, New Jersey teams took all the field performance awards, but two New York City teams  the Warriors from Alfred E. Smith High School in the Bronx and the Harlem Knights of Frederick Douglass Academy and Rice High School in Manhattan  won Judge’s Awards, which recognize a team’s “unique efforts, performance, or dynamics.”Everything about these competitions is photogenic  the game, the “pit” where robots are serviced, the referees and the judges. It is Mr. Press’s team portraits, however, that best tell these students’ story. \n",

A blood vessel in her brain had popped. Within minutes, her left lobe  the source of ego, analysis, judgment and context  began to fail her. Oddly, it felt great.The incessant chatter that normally filled her mind disappeared. Her everyday worries  about a brother with schizophrenia and her high-powered job  untethered themselves from her and slid away. Her perceptions changed, too. She could see that the atoms and molecules making up her body blended with the space around her; the whole world and the creatures in it were all part of the same magnificent field of shimmering energy.“My perception of physical boundaries was no longer limited to where my skin met air,” she has written in her memoir, “My Stroke of Insight,” which was just published by Viking. After experiencing intense pain, she said, her body disconnected from her mind. “I felt like a genie liberated from its bottle,” she wrote in her book. “The energy of my spirit seemed to flow like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent euphoria.” While her spirit soared, her body struggled to live. She had a clot the size of a golf ball in her head, and without the use of her left hemisphere she lost basic analytical functions like her ability to speak, to understand numbers or letters, and even, at first, to recognize her mother. A friend took her to the hospital. Surgery and eight years of recovery followed. Her desire to teach others about nirvana, Dr. Taylor said, strongly motivated her to squeeze her spirit back into her body and to get well.This story is not typical of stroke victims. Left-brain injuries don’t necessarily lead to blissful enlightenment; people sometimes sink into a helplessly moody state: their emotions run riot. Dr. Taylor was also helped because her left hemisphere was not destroyed, and that probably explains how she was able to recover fully.  Today, she says, she is a new person, one who “can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere” on command and be “one with all that is.”To her it is not faith, but science. She brings a deep personal understanding to something she long studied: that the two lobes of the brain have very different personalities. Generally, the left brain gives us context, ego, time, logic. The right brain gives us creativity and empathy. For most English-speakers, the left brain, which processes language, is dominant. Dr. Taylor’s insight is that it doesn’t have to be so.Her message, that people can choose to live a more peaceful, spiritual life by sidestepping their left brain, has resonated widely.In February, Dr. Taylor spoke at the Technology, Entertainment, Design conference (known as TED), the annual forum for presenting innovative scientific ideas. The result was electric. After her 18-minute address was posted as a video on TED’s Web site, she become a mini-celebrity. More than two million viewers have watched her talk, and about 20,000 more a day continue to do so. An interview with her was also posted on Oprah Winfrey’s Web site, and she was chosen as one of Time magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world for 2008. She also receives more than 100 e-mail messages a day from fans. Some are brain scientists, who are fascinated that one of their own has had a stroke and can now come back and translate the experience in terms they can use. Some are stroke victims or their caregivers who want to share their stories and thank her for her openness.But many reaching out are spiritual seekers, particularly Buddhists and meditation practitioners, who say her experience confirms their belief that there is an attainable state of joy. “People are so taken with it,” said Sharon Salzberg, a founder of the Insight Mediation Society in Barre, Mass. “I keep getting that video in e-mail. I must have 100 copies.”She is excited by Dr. Taylor’s speech because it uses the language of science to describe an occurrence that is normally ethereal. Dr. Taylor shows the less mystically inclined, she said, that this experience of deep contentment “is part of the capacity of the human mind.”Since the stroke, Dr. Taylor has moved to Bloomington, Ind., an hour from where she was raised in Terre Haute and where her mother, Gladys Gillman Taylor, who nursed her back to health, still lives.ImageDr. Taylor says\n",

            "used to foster contentment.Credit...AJ Mast for The New York TimesOriginally, Dr. Taylor became a brain scientist  she has a Ph.D. in life sciences with a specialty in neuroanatomy  because she has a mentally ill brother who suffers from delusions that he is in direct contact with Jesus. And for her old research lab at Harvard, she continues to speak on behalf of the mentally ill.But otherwise, she has dialed back her once loaded work schedule. Her house is on a leafy cul-de-sac minutes from Indiana University, which she attended as an undergraduate and where she now teaches at the medical school. Her foyer is painted a vibrant purple. She greets a stranger at the door with a warm hug. When she talks, her pale blue eyes make extended contact.Never married, she lives with her dog and two cats. She unselfconsciously calls her mother, 82, her best friend. She seems bemused but not at all put off by the hundreds who have reached out to her on a spiritual level. Religious ecstatics who claim to see angels have asked her to appear on their radio and television programs. She has declined these offers. Although her father is an Episcopal minister and she was raised in his church, she cannot be counted among the traditionally faithful. “Religion is a story that the left brain tells the right brain,” she said. Still, Dr. Taylor says, “nirvana exists right now.” “There is no doubt that it is a beautiful state and that we can get there,” she said. That belief has certainly sparked debate. On Web sites like evolvingbeings.com and in Eckhart Tolle discussion groups, people debate whether she is truly enlightened or just physically damaged and confused.Even her own scientific brethren have wondered. “When I saw her on the TED video, at first I thought, Oh my god, is she losing it,” said Dr. Francine M. Benes, director of the Harvard Brain Tissue Resource Center, where Dr. Taylor once worked.Dr. Benes makes clear that she still thinks Dr. Taylor is an extraordinary and competent woman. “It is just that the mystical side was not apparent when she was at Harvard,” Dr. Benes said.Dr. Taylor makes no excuses or apologies, or even explanations. She says instead that she continues to battle her left brain for the better. She gently offers tips on how it might be done. “As the child of divorced parents and a mentally ill brother, I was angry,” she said. Now when she feels anger rising, she trumps it with a thought of a person or activity that brings her pleasure. No meditation necessary, she says, just the belief that the left brain can be tamed. Her newfound connection to other living beings means that she is no longer interested in performing experiments on live rat brains, which she did as a researcher. She is committed to making time for passions  physical and visual  that she believes exercise her right brain, including water-skiing, guitar playing and stained-glass making. A picture of one of her intricate stained-glass pieces  of a brain  graces the cover of her book.Karen Armstrong, a religious historian who has written several popular books including one on the Buddha, says there are odd parallels between his story and Dr. Taylor’s. “Like this lady, he was reluctant to return to this world,” she said. “He wanted to luxuriate in the sense of enlightenment.”But, she said, “the dynamic of the religious required that he go out into the world and share his sense of compassion.”And in the end, compassion is why Dr. Taylor says she wrote her memoir. She thinks there is much to be mined from her experience on how brain-trauma patients might best recover and, in fact, she hopes to open a center in Indiana to treat such patients based on those principles. And then there is the question of world peace. No, Dr. Taylor doesn’t know how to attain that, but she does think the right hemisphere could help. Or as she told the TED conference:“I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner peace circuitry of our right hemispheres, the more peace we will project into the world, and the more peaceful our planet will be.” It almost seems like science.\n",
            "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/us/25aging.html?searchResultPosition=3;2008-05-25;us;High-Tech Devices Keep Elderly Safe From Afar;First thing every morning, Lynn Pitet, of Cody, Wyo., checks her computer to see whether her mother, Helen Trost, has gotten out of bed, taken her medication and whether she is moving around inside her house hundreds of miles away in Minnesota.Last summer, Mrs. Trost’s husband had a stroke and died, but she wanted to stay in the house, in Mankato, where she had lived for 36 years. She did not want a live-in helper, and she cannot drive. At 88, Mrs. Trost has macular degeneration and takes medications for seizures, memory loss and restless leg syndrome.“She’s a feisty gal,” Mrs. Pitet said of her mother. “She is fine when she takes her medicines, but, even so, I was terrified of leaving her alone.”Mrs. Pitet and her sister decided to become part of a small but growing number of people who have installed motion sensors and a remote monitoring system to keep aging relatives safe. Sensors attached to the wall are able to register when Mrs. Trost gets out of bed and whether she stops at her medication dispenser, and to alert her daughters to any deviations from her routine that might indicate an accident or illness. The family is updated by electronic report every morning. Monitoring systems like these, which go far beyond the emergency response buttons that have been around for years, are not found in many homes yet. Privacy is an issue for some older people, and the basic package can range from $50 up to $85 a month for the motion sensors and remote monitoring system like Mrs. Trost uses. More comprehensive packages can include devices to track blood pressure, weight or respiration. Experts on aging say the systems will become commonplace as the 76 million baby boomers approach ages when disabilities or conditions like diabetes and failing eyesight jeopardize the ability to live independently. The population of those 65 years and older is almost 40 million today, and the federal Census Bureau says that will more than double, to nearly 87 million, by midcentury.Right now, there is little federal health care reimbursement for such devices. And private insurance coverage is evolving because the area is new, said Dr. Jeremy Nobel, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who co-wrote a study on the feasibility of such technologies. “We are at the beginning stages regarding the availability of such services and before business models are developed,” said Dr. Nobel, a medical doctor. “I expect we’ll see a significant increase in the adoption of such systems in two to five years, and widespread adoption in 10 years.”The coming wave of aging Americans threatens to swamp the existing stock of retirement communities, assisted living and nursing home facilities  making it impossible to accommodate everyone who will need, or might want, more structured care.Experts on aging say motion sensors and other high-tech devices will help cover the shortfall, allowing older people to live independently for longer. The growing number of Alzheimer’s sufferers, which is expected to more than triple from the current four million by 2050, may also spur wider adoption of technologies like motion sensors to alert others to deviations in routine, trackers to assure medications are taken and emergency response buttons. Technology systems to underpin living independently, or what some call “aging in place,” are still years from being rolled out in a big way, awaiting adequate financing for research and other incentives, like coverage by insurance companies, according to Mr. Nobel’s study, which was released in March by the Center for Aging Services Technologies, a program of the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging. But projects are under way around the country to test high-tech gadgets for home use, including wireless sensors and devices to regulate temperature, lights and appliances, and sophisticated medical monitors. And some care providers have begun to equip clients with devices that fit their needs. NewCourtland Elder Services, a care provider for some 2,000 people in Philadelphia, started a yearlong pilot in 2006 that equipped 33 patients living on their own with remote sensors that tracked changes in their health or living patterns that required early medical intervention, said Kim Brooks, the vice president for housing and services at NewCourtland. One of the patients is Cleora Coley, 77, a retired pharmacy technician, who is in a wheelchair after losing a leg to diabetes. Two years ago, Ms. Coley moved to a living complex for the elderly because she could not maneuver the stairs in her family home. In her apartment, she checks her blood pressure with a cuff that automatically sends the reading to a monitoring center, which notifies her and her doctor of any change. Sensors placed in each room keep track of her movements, and she has a button to summon assistance, which she used in April when she fell.“I’m alone but I know I’m not all by myself,” Mrs. Coley said, adding, “And I really like my independence.” NewCourtland is starting a trial in cooperation with health insurance companies and home health agencies, installing medical monitoring devices in 1,000 residences over the next six months.One major roadblock for wider adoption of in-home monitoring has been concern that older people, unused to everyday technologies like the Internet, would resist their use. That was true for Mrs. Trost, who said she was apprehensive about having electronic gadgets around but said she had found that “they are really no bother.” A survey by AARP found that older people were willing to use high-tech devices at home, and to pay about $50 a month. The privacy issue made John T. Fowlkes, 86, of Raleigh, N.C., hesitate last year when his children wanted to install a motion sensor system. “What convinced me was that there are no cameras,” said Mr. Fowlkes, a retired postal service distribution clerk who lives by himself in an apartment building for retired people. “I get peace of mind, but no one is looking at me.” Some exploration into future technologies is being financed by the National Institute on Aging, part of the National Institutes of Health, which has been giving grants to entrepreneurs to develop devices like a video data collection system to analyze an elderly person’s activity level. But most research dollars have come from private companies like Intel Corporation. Intel researchers are developing devices like a “memory bracelet” that vibrates at a specified time to remind the wearer of a doctor’s appointment or to take medication. Also in trials are sensor-infused carpets  Eric Dishman, Intel’s director of product research, calls them “magic carpets”  and wearable sensors, which would measure changes in gait, to help avoid falls.Intel invested $3 million with the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology, which runs what it calls a living laboratory, with 225 volunteers. The project, which also received $7 million from the federal aging institute, uses sensors on walls, doorways and appliances  and computer games  to detect cognitive decline. “There is going to be a major transformation in health care because of these technologies,” said Dr. Jeffrey Kaye, director of the center, at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, who oversees the project. “It’s more a question of when rather than whether.” Recognizing the commercial potential of technologies for the aging, dozens of companies, including GE Healthcare, IBM and Medtronic, two years ago formed the Continua Health Alliance to develop products to aid older people. Despite the projects, trials and commercial interest, Mr. Dishman said the United States was “missing in action” in aging technologies, compared with Europe.“There just hasn’t been enough research and development yet to prove these technologies work,” he said. “None of us wants to put a bunch of technology in homes of frail elders unless it does.”He said the European Union had committed $1.5 billion to developing independent-living technologies. Last year, Intel partnered with Ireland’s government to open the Technology Research for Independent Living Center, known as Tril, in Dublin, to invent and test independent-living technologies in the households of hundreds of older people.So far, he said, a dozen other countries and 30 universities have approached Tril for advice and assistance.\n",
            "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/books/review/Dunn-t.html?searchResultPosition=5;2008-05-25;books;Partial Recall;Behind all the good-natured joking about “senior moments” lies real frustration and fear. How empowering, then, that we can do something to ward off normal, age-related memory loss: exercise. No, it’s not as easy as popping a pill. But as Sue Halpern reports in “Can’t Remember What I Forgot,” even a few brisk walks per week can have a measurable effect. Exercise promotes the birth of new neurons in the very part of the hippocampus (a brain structure crucial to forming new memories) that begins to malfunction with age. Exercise also counters age-related shrinking of the prefrontal cortex, an area involved in concentration and working memory (as in remembering a phone number long enough to dial).Of course, if you’re unwilling to exercise for your health, or even to look good in a bathing suit, perhaps you’re still hoping for an easier solution. The problem, Halpern explains, is that solid, peer-reviewed science has not yet proved that anything else works: not herbal supplements, fish oil, vitamin E, almonds, $400 interactive computer software or even crossword puzzles. (After reading her section on blueberries, however, you’ll want to buy them by the bucketful.) To cut through the hype and confusion, Halpern, whose father had dementia, set out to discover what scientists really know, and how close they are to a drug or therapy that works  either for the pathological memory loss caused by Alzheimer’s, or the “normal” kind that happens inexorably as we age. Her most interesting passages highlight the distinctions between the two. Both ravage the hippocampus; yet a different part of the hippocampus is “broken” in each condition, and different molecules have stopped doing their jobs. “To understand something to the point of being able to fix it you have to get down to the molecular level,” Scott Small, a neurologist at Columbia, tells Halpern. “And that’s where we’re at.” Yet for a book subtitled “The Good News From the Front Lines of Memory Research,” the hope it contains is markedly thin. Most of this “good news” involves new methods for the early detection of Alzheimer’s, which can offer patients only time to plan for an unavoidable fate. ImageCredit...Francesco BongiorniAs part of her research, Halpern volunteered for a host of tests that can help diagnose dementia, including a variety of brain scans. She puts her own process of discovery front and center, reporting on cutting-edge science through the story of her interactions with scientists. Halpern, a nature writer and novelist, seems most at home unfolding a scene in naturalistic detail. The richest material comes from her 2005 New Yorker article about Scott Small’s boss, Richard Mayeux, and his research team’s search for a new gene linked to late-onset Alzheimer’s. Suddenly we’re among gamblers, prostitutes and chickens in the early-morning streets of the Dominican Republic, driving to meet the families with Alzheimer’s whose blood samples will reveal the new risk-factor gene. Unfortunately, Halpern’s enviable powers of description are often squandered on details that seem off-point. For instance, she gives a blow-by-blow account of her six-hour marathon of memory testing, and of her experience lying prone in each brain scanner. She also walks us down too many blind alleys in her reporting. Consider her enthusiasm for a memory drug being developed at a secretive start-up called Sention. “I was the first writer allowed through the door,” she boasts, exhilarated, describing the history and science behind this “honest-to-God gold mine of a wonder drug” in detail. Next thing we know, Sention has gone out of business. More troublesome are some of Halpern’s sloppy descriptions of the science itself. She writes that flavanoids, celebrated for their cardiovascular health benefits, are a “class of plants” (in truth, they are chemicals found in plants) and at one point assigns “red wine” to this group. She writes that two human genes  the presenilin genes  cause early-onset Alzheimer’s, but are “carried by only a few hundred families worldwide.” (We all carry the genes; what most of us don’t carry are rare, Alzheimer’s-causing mutations in them.) Part of Halpern’s self-deprecating charm is that she is one of “us,” the general public, fretting about her lapses in memory and pushing scientists to answer our most pressing questions. But readers may sometimes wish for a more authoritative guide. When Small proposes that the “giant, complex thing called normal memory decline could be accounted for by a single molecule,” Halpern is stunned. If this “renegade idea” is correct, she suggests, Small may set off an explosive scientific revolution à la Thomas Kuhn. Well, perhaps the revolution was not adequately televised, but what Small is proposing is a now-standard idea: that changes to single molecules can radically alter brain function and behavior. (Think of SSRIs, like Prozac, for depression.) He even gives Halpern several examples, ranging from Huntington’s disease to the sexual behavior of male prairie voles. All told, Halpern sees “many reasons to cheer,” given the “smart and committed people” searching for cures. Still, her book ends with a note of disappointment. When Small announces another incremental breakthrough, Halpern can’t help thinking: “All that work in his lab and, so far, in the clinic, not a lot to show for it.” The book itself is a valuable snapshot in time. It lacks, however, a vivid, overarching narrative that would have maintained its value once the science moves on. In the current glut of books about memory, sad to say, this one is likely to be forgotten.\n",

Scaling portions of an old stone wall, now and then dunking from moss bed into mud, the Hansons and others upturned rocks, in search of at least one member of Connecticut’s dozen native salamander species.They were on a mission to tally salamanders as participants in one of a series of “citizen science” outings organized by the Mystic Aquarium and Institute for Exploration’s Amphibian Monitoring Project. The aquarium is helping in an international bid to save frogs and amphibians by identifying and counting species amid scientists’ concerns that some of them have become vulnerable in recent years.As spring progresses, the aquarium’s amphibian monitors will conduct weekly searches starting 30 minutes after sunset or later, at a chosen wetlands site. The monitoring program will eventually widen to include Connecticut’s eight species of frogs and two toad species.By the end of the hunt, Keaton Hanson, 10, had caught a four-toed salamander and his brother, Kyler, 8, had a red back specimen to show. “It’s a fun and worthy exercise for my family to get involved in a big science project at the local level,” Mr. Hanson said. “My father was a biologist. I’ve had a lifelong interest in it. I want to give my kids that exposure.”Before the hunt, MaryEllen Mateleska, an educator for the aquarium, told the volunteers that there are 5,500 frog and amphibian species worldwide.Of these, 1,500 species are reportedly in decline, and 34 species have become extinct. Of the 280 amphibian species in the United States, 38 are on the Endangered Species Act’s official list.Biologists say the causes for the United States decline include habitat loss (the prevalent cause for species endangerment in Connecticut, Ms. Mateleska said) pollutants, invasive species and parasites and diseases. FrogwatchUSA, established by the National Wildlife Federation of Reston, Va., and the United States Geological Survey, created this rendition of citizen science, in which members of the public are asked to gather localized field data, like which species are discovered where and the number of animals found at each location.While they are aiding science, volunteers are introduced to homespun projects to help preserve a species. In the aquarium’s case, for example, Ms. Mateleska provided instructions for creating “Toad Abodes”  habitats that could be made of terra cotta pots or rock piles.It was frog finding that dominated Ms. Mateleska’s training session. There are, she said, two strategies involved. The first is “kick-flip,” to bring a specimen to light, “careful flip, careful return and watchful eye.” The second strategy is to find and identify frogs by their songs: “recording the ribbit,” in FrogwatchUSA parlance. The songs can vary from the sweet jingle from a colony of tiny spring peepers to the low groans of American bullfrogs, which inhabit streams, fresh ponds and rivers throughout Connecticut. After sunset is the optimal time to hear the songs, according to FrogwatchUSA. The group asks that each outing report include conditions like air temperature, wind speed, current precipitation and a weather history of the site.Monitors will also record the time they begin listening for the songs, the time they stop listening, different species heard and  by using a specialized device  the intensity of each species’ sounds. Their findings will then go to FrogwatchUSA.After searching for salamanders, Kyler said: “I haven’t learned much about salamanders in school.”Keaton said he found unearthing the four-toed salamander exciting.\n",

            "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/25/world/americas/25amazon.html?searchResultPosition=9;2008-05-25;world;Brazil Rainforest Analysis Sets Off Political Debate;SÃO JOSÉ DOS CAMPOS, Brazil  Gilberto Câmara, a scientist who leads Brazil’s national space agency, is more at ease poring over satellite data of the Amazon than being thrust into the spotlight.But since January, Dr. Câmara has been at the center of a political tug-of-war between scientists and Brazil’s powerful business interests. It started when he and his fellow engineers released a report showing that deforestation of Brazil’s portion of the rainforest seemed to have shot up again after two years of decline.Since then, Dr. Câmara, who leads the National Institute for Space Research here, has found himself having to defend his agency’s findings against one of Brazil’s richest and most powerful men: Blairo Maggi, who is governor of the country’s largest agricultural state, Mato Grosso, and a business owner known as the “Soybean King.”Governor Maggi was exercised enough by the report  which led to harsh measures stifling business in his state  that he asked for, and was granted, a meeting with the president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. The stakes could not be higher for Mr. da Silva. Stewardship of the Amazon has always been a touchy subject, with many Brazilians fearful that world powers would try to impose their standards on the rainforest. In recent years, the debate over the Amazon has intensified, with many outside the country seeing an intact rainforest as a key to controlling global warming. At the same time, Brazil’s economy has taken off  largely because of businesses that are claiming more of the Amazon’s land for crops and livestock, and more of its trees for logging.Mr. da Silva has spent the last several years  walking a careful line, trying to maintain his image as Brazil’s first “green” president, which has gained him international cachet, without threatening Brazil’s agriculture industry at a time of soaring grain and meat prices. Dr. Câmara’s findings made the president’s balancing act harder and turned up the heat on what had been a long-simmering battle between businesses and environmentalists. It did not help that the scientists’ report, released in January, relied heavily on progressive deforestation, a relatively new measure that is is widely accepted by environmentalists but that Governor Maggi contends is tantamount to lying. The space agency argues that this slower-paced deforestation, where parts of the forest are thinned out little by little rather than at once, can be just as devastating.The criticism of the report worried scientists in and out of Brazil, including Dr. Câmara. “Science,” he said, “should not bow to authority.”ImageA report produced by Gilberto Câmara, above, a scientist who leads Brazil’s national space agency, has been criticized for its heavy reliance on a relatively new measure of deforestation.Credit...Lalo de Almeida for The New York TimesThe space agency, known as INPE, reported in January that deforestation had hit an estimated 4,300 square miles between August and December of last year. If that pace continues, the yearly total for deforestation would jump; the number was approximately 6,900 square miles from August 2006 to August 2007. The agency’s data also showed that 54 percent of the deforestation had occurred in Mato Grosso, Governor Maggi’s state, where the scientists said ranchers and loggers pushed farther into the rainforest.Some of the deforestation is legal. Owners are allowed to clear 20 percent of their land in the rainforest. Nonetheless, the report was a headache for the government. Mr. da Silva has received international attention in recent years for the country’s growing biofuels program and for the recent two-year drop in deforestation. Suddenly environmentalists across the world were again criticizing Brazil’s efforts to save the rainforest.The attacks on the space agency made some environmentalists worry publicly that the president might cave in to pressure from businesses.   Environmentalists became even more alarmed when Marina Silva, Brazil’s environmental minister and a respected rainforest defender, resigned this month. While leaving, she spoke of heavy pressures being exerted by industry-minded governors, including Governor Maggi, to reverse the federal crackdown on destruction of the forest.Still, Mr. da Silva responded to the space agency’s report with tough measures, including imposing credit restrictions on those found to be involved in illegal forest-clearing and creating a Arc of Fire, a multi-agency police operation that conducts surprise raids to catch illegal loggers. The space agency has two systems for measuring deforestation. Prodes, a yearly satellite analysis, measures deforested areas as small as about 15 acres, while Deter, a lower-resolution system, maps areas greater than about 60 acres in real-time, giving law enforcement information to act quickly to stop further destruction. The dispute over the space agency’s figures has centered on the information provided by Deter. In the past, Dr. Câmara said, the agency included mostly large swaths of cleared land in its analysis. But environmental researchers have been clamoring for years for satellite researchers to expand monitoring to include areas thinned by logging and surface fires, rather than just areas that have been clear cut. The agency uses the term progressive deforestation to refer to the slower form of forest degradation that has become increasingly common in the Amazon in recent years and which Dr. Câmara said the agency began including in its analysis in 2005. The latest deforestation alerts have shown that about one-third of newly deforested areas were from progressive degradation, of which more than 75 percent were “severely degraded,” he said.“We had to ask ourselves what happened between forest and clear-cut,” said Dr. Câmara, 52, who has been with the agency for 26 years. “With a view that if you are going to do prevention and enforcement, you need to be there as rapidly as possible.”In other words, if farmers, loggers and others are clearing illegally, but slowly, the government, by identifying thinned-out areas, has a better chance to catch them before a large area has been affected. “We are satisfied with the technology we have,” Dr. Câmara said. “It is the largest use of remote sensing data for environmental protection worldwide on a systematic basis of any country.” But for Governor Maggi, who leads the state that has become a locomotive in Brazil’s surging agriculture industry, news that Mato Grosso was once again the worst deforestation offender was difficult to accept. While he is lauded by many for pioneering Brazil’s expansion into the world soybean market, his pro-industry stance and actions as head of a soybean-growing business have made him a frequent target of environmentalists. Greenpeace gave him the Golden Chainsaw Award in 2005 for being the Brazilian who most contributed to the destruction of the rainforest. Governor Maggi’s chief of staff, Alexander Torres Maia, did not respond to phone calls seeking comment, and he did not reply to a list of questions sent via e-mail last week. In recent years, critics say Governor Maggi has softened his all-out defense of the rights of businesses out of political necessity. But that did not stop his administration from challenging the satellite data. Officials in Mato Grosso said that the state’s environmental agency had never heard of progressive deforestation. “We could see this wasn’t deforestation, it was burning of fields and old deforestation,” Luis Henrique Chaves Daldegan, Mato Grosso’s environment secretary, said in an interview. Mato Grosso’s environmental agency worked to gather evidence to prove the space agency had overreached. Technicians compared satellite images dating from 2000, went to disputed locations and shot photos of what was there today. Mr. Daldegan said the pictures proved that the space agency was declaring land that had been deforested as far back as 2000 as newly cleared.On March 25, the state agency provided Dr. Câmara with a detailed report that included 854 photos of areas in Mato Grosso that the space agency had included in its tally. The state report contended that only 10 percent of the areas had recently been deforested. Dr. Câmara put 10 of the 50 specialists that had produced the deforestation analysis onto the task of analyzing Mato Grosso’s photos and data. They worked intensely for six weeks, he said, sometimes time-stamping their analysis of the photos after midnight.“There was clearly a sense of urgency,” Dr. Câmara said.In the end, the space agency said that 96 percent of its initial assessments had been correct.“INPE is very proud, and the internal pressures were almost stronger than the external pressures to show that science would win out,” Dr. Câmara said. He did, however, agree to try using higher-resolution satellites in the future to improve the reliability of his agency’s analysis. Mr. Daldegan said he is still not satisfied. “We don’t think this is the end of the story,” Dr. Câmara said. “They did not ask us to stop doing this data. So this was a step forward.”\n",

In short order, it spread around the Internet like kudzu.The item, “Why Zappos Pays New Employees to Quit  And You Should Too,” written by William C. Taylor, applauded Zappos for what he called its unmatched customer service and for its insistence on thinking beyond the current fiscal quarter (discussionleader.hbsp.com/taylor).“There are plenty of companies with a hot product, a hip style or a fast-rising stock price that are, essentially, one-trick ponies  they deliver great short-term results, but they don’t stand for anything big or important for the long term,” Mr. Taylor wrote.Not so at Zappos, which Mr. Taylor says will record $1 billion in sales this year, up from $70 million five years ago. Zappos delivers shoes, handbags and other products ordered over the Internet. Delivery is free and fast, and customers can return unwanted products at no charge. “This company is fanatical about great service,” Mr. Taylor wrote, “not just satisfying customers, but amazing them.” In an age of clueless, surly or impossible-to-reach customer service personnel, Zappos’s fanaticism helps it stand out. It is all in the hiring. After a few weeks of intensive training, new call-center employees are offered $1,000 on top of what they have earned to that point if they want to quit. ImageCredit...Alex Eben MeyerThe theory, according to Mr. Taylor, is that the people who take the money “obviously don’t have the sense of commitment” Zappos requires from its employees. The company says about 10 percent of its trainees take the offer.Zappos’s reputation preceded the Harvard Business item, of course. “Honestly, I’m getting to the point of burnout on hearing about Zappos in marketing circles,” Robert John Ed wrote on his blog (redmarketer.com). But he still felt compelled to note this week that “the secret to Zappos’s success is real commitment that permeates through every customer and every transaction, every time.”GLASS CEILING Why are women having such a hard time achieving parity on Wall Street? John Carney (dealbreaker.com) wrote this week that the question persisted “despite some truly incredible efforts on the parts of Wall Street institutions to recruit, retain and promote women.”Mr. Carney surmises that the gender gap in math and science may be responsible for the gender gap on Wall Street. That is not because of any deficiency on the part of women but because, on average, they are simply not as interested in math and science as men are.“Could it be,” he asks, “that many women who leave Wall Street  or decline to show up there in the first place  are simply doing other things because they want to?”LATE TO THE BANDWAGON Taco Bell’s latest online marketing campaign is not going over well with some bloggers. The campaign, “Why Pay Mo’ ” includes a depiction of four men dancing to a rap song, their heads replaced with pictures of a penny, a nickel, a dime and a quarter. “Yo, cuz,” the rappers implore, “go find some coins in your couch, O.K.?”Viewers can replace the coin heads with pictures of their own. And a “rap name generator” asks, 1988-style, whether you are a “homeboy” or a “flygirl,” requests that you choose a menu item, then gives you a name like “Sir Biggie D-Dizzle Tak-O.” It is unclear what you are supposed to do with your new handle. “Sorry, Taco Bell, but you missed the rap boat when Ronald McDonald got down with the homies in, like, 2003,” Angela Natividad wrote (adrants.com).

            "https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/24/us/24pastor.html?searchResultPosition=3;2008-05-24;us;Spotlight Recasts Church Leaders and Their Support;When George W. Bush ran for president in 2000, an influential megachurch pastor from Texas made an early endorsement that helped him win over skeptical evangelical conservatives.That pastor was the Rev. John C. Hagee.At the time, Mr. Hagee was pretty much the same public person he is today: a hard-line pro-Israel preacher and best-selling author whose evangelistic enterprise was built on apocalyptic prophecies that many Jews, Roman Catholics and other Christians found disturbing. Yet it was never an issue when Mr. Bush’s campaign trumpeted the support of Mr. Hagee, as well as that of multimedia evangelists like Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell. Eight years later, Mr. Hagee’s presidential endorsement is suddenly more a curse than a blessing. On Thursday, four months after Senator John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican candidate, stood next to Mr. Hagee at a news conference and announced how delighted he was to have his endorsement, Mr. McCain renounced it. He acted after a Web site released a recording of a sermon in which Mr. Hagee said Hitler and the Holocaust had been part of God’s plan to chase the Jews from Europe and drive them to Palestine. Mr. McCain also rejected the endorsement of the Rev. Rod Parsley, an Ohio pastor who had been retooling his church into a get-out-the-vote machine for Republicans. The problem for Mr. McCain was that Mr. Parsley was vocally anti-Islam. Presidential candidates have always had to vet their vice-presidential candidates, their consultants, their pollsters and their major donors. Campaign 2008 is proving that they also have to vet their members of the clergy. It started with Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the leading Democratic candidate, who denounced his own former pastor and spiritual mentor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., after Mr. Wright aired his Afro-centric version of conspiracy thinking at the National Press Club. Then liberals and Democrats insisted that Mr. McCain’s endorsers among the clergy also be scrutinized. Preachers who gain large followings precisely because they can whip up their flocks with compelling performances from the pulpit can turn toxic when those performances are aired before the broader public. “As Jeremiah Wright discovered, what you say inside really often gets you into trouble outside,” said James L. Guth, a professor of political science at Furman University in Greenville, S.C.“There are certain kinds of language, certain interpretations that are really meant for insiders, and take on a different interpretive frame outside the community,” Dr. Guth said. “Any religious tradition runs that risk.” Mr. McCain did not renounce Mr. Parsley’s endorsement until one of Mr. Parsley’s fire-and-brimstone sermons was seen on television and the Internet. In it, he proclaimed, “Islam is an anti-Christ religion that intends through violence to conquer the world.”Fear-mongering about Islam has become a staple of some well-known evangelical preachers since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, so Mr. Parsley’s assertions might not sound outrageous to the ears of evangelicals. However, said John C. Green, senior fellow at the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, “Now we are much more attentive to the fact that Muslim Americans are a part of our communities, and that in a religiously diverse country there has to be a civil discourse.” In previous campaigns, there was little stigma for a politician who cozied up to a controversial clergyman. Mr. Bush pursued the endorsements of Mr. Robertson and Mr. Falwell in 2000, largely because he was competing for conservative Christian voters against evangelical darlings like Gary L. Bauer, Alan Keyes and Steve Forbes. Two years earlier, Mr. Robertson had created a flutter of controversy when he said that if Disney World kept opening its doors to gay events, “I would warn Orlando that you’re right in the way of some serious hurricanes, and I don’t think I’d be waving those flags in God’s face if I were you.”  Mr. Bush welcomed Mr. Robertson’s support in 2000 and 2004, and last year, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, also triumphantly accepted Mr. Robertson’s backing. But Mr. Robertson had such a long history of outrageous remarks that perhaps people had stopped being outraged. And Mr. Giuliani dropped out of the race before Mr. Wright brought more scrutiny to candidates’ clerical companions. It is too early to tell how Mr. McCain’s disavowal of Mr. Hagee and Mr. Parsley will affect the conservative evangelical voting bloc that he was trying to win over.Grant Wacker, professor of Christian history at the Duke University Divinity School, said, “McCain doesn’t have much to lose in disassociating himself from Hagee, because he really does represent a marginalized subculture within evangelism.”Mr. Green said he expected that in the future politicians would scrub their endorsers among the clergy more carefully. “That doesn’t mean that candidates are going to give up pursuing religious voters, and it doesn’t mean that pastors and religious leaders are not key,” he said. “But candidates are going to be much more cautious.”\n",

Kennedy’s summit meeting with Nikita S. Khrushchev in 1961 is that “sometimes there is good reason to fear to negotiate.” I disagree.In what sense did Khrushchev triumph  even temporarily? The issue over Berlin was Khrushchev’s threat to deny Western access rights to West Berlin, by military force if necessary. After building the wall between East and West Berlin, he abandoned his pressure on the access routes, and the viability of West Berlin (Kennedy’s prime objective) was assured. As for “fear to negotiate,” why should the stronger party ever fear negotiation? Ronald Reagan did not, when he sought out our Soviet adversaries. Refusing to talk and refusing to negotiate are dead-end streets, as the Soviet leaders before Mikhail S. Gorbachev never learned. And that’s why they lost.  Jack F. Matlock Jr. Princeton, N.J., May 22, 2008The writer, United States ambassador to the Soviet Union, 1987-91, as an officer of the American Embassy in Moscow helped translate Khrushchev’s letters to Kennedy during the Cuban missile crisis.To the Editor: Nathan Thrall and Jesse James Wilkins are right, to a point. In 1961, John F. Kennedy was a new president, and indeed Nikita S. Khrushchev had the upper hand. But what also should be mentioned is the interaction between the two men a year later at the time of the far more consequential Cuban missile crisis. By that time, the two leaders had come to know one another and were able to reach a compromise. The reality was that Kennedy had gained his political sea legs and Khrushchev could trust and respect that. Their dialogue after the summit meeting continued and made all the difference in the outcome of the Cuban missile crisis. That may well be the reason any of us are here at all.Peter Barkley  Cambridge, Mass., May 22, 2008To the Editor:I don’t agree with the conclusions that Nathan Thrall and Jesse James Wilkins have drawn from John F. Kennedy’s encounter with Nikita S. Khrushchev in 1961. The problem was not Kennedy’s going to Vienna, but his obvious lack of preparation for the meeting. An American president should never fear to negotiate, because it takes a very powerful option off the table. But the president should be extremely well prepared before such an exercise. ImageCredit...Dan KrallKennedy could have anticipated Khrushchev’s aggressive style and steeled himself with appropriate countermeasures. He could have identified American and Soviet interests for the meeting to see if there was any common ground, set very specific goals and developed a strategy for how to accomplish them, including the possibility that going himself was the wrong move at that juncture. Kennedy was right to say that the United States should never fear to negotiate. But he should have added that American negotiators need to be extremely well prepared. Eileen F. Babbitt  Medford, Mass., May 22, 2008The writer is a professor of practice in international conflict management at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University.To the Editor:While Nathan Thrall and Jesse James Wilkins are right that summit meetings and indeed any negotiations can go wrong, we also need to consider the likely results of refusing to talk. This has not worked to our advantage with Iran, and the halt in North Korea’s main (and probably only) functioning nuclear program came about only when the United States dropped its refusal to engage in bilateral negotiations. Robert Jervis  New York, May 22, 2008The writer is a professor of international politics at Columbia University.To the Editor: Nathan Thrall and Jesse James Wilkins argue that President John F. Kennedy’s disastrous summit meeting with Nikita S. Khrushchev was a result of the president’s naïve rush to meet with an enemy leader. There was another factor  Kennedy may well have been high on amphetamines. As Lawrence K. Altman and I reported in The New York Times on Dec. 4, 1972, Kennedy was accompanied to the summit by Dr. Max Jacobson, a physician who routinely injected the stimulant into many prominent figures. Dr. Jacobson told us that he injected Kennedy there. White House records confirm that the doctor was on that trip. It is not certain that the shots contained “speed,” but Dr. Feelgood, as patients called him, is known routinely to have mixed amphetamines into his potions. The drug causes not only feelings of euphoria but also an exaggerated sense of power and superiority.

Build a Bigger and Brighter Billboard;They could be 212-foot-high, flat black stealth bomber wings studded with tiny jewels, soaring 17 stories above the crossroads of the world. Soon enough, their gemlike lights will glow brilliantly as the signature elements of the largest advertising billboard in Times Square, trumpeted by its designers as the world’s most complex, powerful and digitally advanced new supersign, with unequaled high-resolution graphics. The billboard, traditionally called a “spectacular” on the Great White Way, is already visible, yet still very much under construction. In sheathing the east, west and south sides of 1 Times Square, it will show the flag of the Walgreen Company, the nation’s largest drugstore chain in sales, which is promoting a new three-level, 16,200-square-foot emporium in the building’s ground-floor retail space, which has been empty for seven years.The multicomponent, 250,000-pound sign will be programmed from street level to 341 feet high at the top of the building, on the traffic island between Broadway and Seventh Avenue at 42nd Street. Best known as the mother ship for a patchwork of billboards and the place where the ball drops on New Year’s Eve, the building was originally called the Times Tower, the 25-story, 1904 headquarters of the newspaper that gave the square its name. The store is expected to be unveiled, and the billboard officially illuminated, next fall. The sign will have 12 million light-emitting diodes, known as L.E.D.’s  17,000 square feet of them, “which is more than a third of an acre,” said Arthur Gilmore, president of the Gilmore Group, a Manhattan design and branding consulting firm, which created the sign. “Including its digital and vinyl decorative components, it will be 43,720 square feet in area.” The new spectacular “will be larger than any sign in Times Square,” said Barry E. Winston, a Times Square project consultant who has been a billboard expert for more than 50 years. He said it would surpass the current behemoth, the 11,000-square-foot Nasdaq sign on Broadway at 43rd Street. ImageThe big sign the Walgreen Company is building boasts distinctive “wings” that stretch up the facade past the Dow Jones zipper.Credit...Todd Heisler/The New York TimesWalgreen is trying to raise its visibility in New York, a city seemingly overrun by Duane Reade, Rite Aid and CVS, where residents seem to need another drugstore even less than they need another bank. This does not deter Walgreen, which sees “the sign and the store as a focal point for us nationally,” said Craig M. Sinclair, a Walgreen divisional advertising vice president. Walgreen has 22 stores in the five boroughs; it will have 5 more by the end of the year, and plans a dozen more by 2010. Mr. Sinclair estimated that the sign would be seen by 1.6 million passers-by daily.  “There was a jumble of signs at 1 Times Square, and no continuity,” Mr. Gilmore said. “Now, three sides of the building will be programmed as a single entity.”  And so, the sign components of the east and west facades of the building, which are 341 feet tall and 143 feet wide, will be programmed “in a synchronized way, as a single animation,” said Meric Adriansen, a managing partner of D3, a digital design company in North Bergen, N.J., that designed the hardware and software for Walgreen. These animations  largely advertising spots  will run from 15 to 60 seconds. Enhancing the digital screens will be “passive,” or nondigital, custom-printed decorative opaque vinyls as well as lighter printed vinyl-mesh scrims of the kind used in bus graphics. The scrims are perforated so that they do not rip apart in the wind.ImageDavid Pelio was overseeing the installation of the sign.Credit...Todd Heisler/The New York TimesOther advertisers with screens on the northern face of the building have long-term leases. Those screens will remain, as will several nondigital vinyl billboards on the east and west facades. In the language of supersigns, the Walgreen billboard will be “densely populated” with L.E.D.’s that are as close as six millimeters apart. The sign will marshal enough candlepower to withstand the sun at high noon. Its images will be projected by 12 million red, green and blue L.E.D.’s programmed to glow in different configurations so that the brains of human observers interpret them as images. A trillion colors are programmable. The elements of the sign, programmed and directed from a control room in the building, require 200 disk drives to govern both sides of the building. The digital components of the sign, using 16.6 miles of power and data cables, require the installation of 77 10-foot-tall, 5,000-pound “cabinets” brought by truck from a steel fabricator in Oregon. These cabinets, weatherproofed assemblages of diode arrays, are being lifted and bolted to 30 tons of new steel supports on the building, with more than a half million nuts, bolts and screws. ImageAn artist's rendering of the digital supersign in Times Square.Credit...Gilmore GroupOn a recent night, a cabinet section dangled from a crane as riggers bolted it into place. The supersign’s distinctive features are “the diagonals,” as Mr. Gilmore called them: 27-foot-wide programmable digital elements on the east and west facades that will extend from about 12 feet above the ground. The two diagonals will be interrupted by the Dow Jones zipper, as well as the tower’s structural elements, but “the diagonals pull the sign and the building together,” Mr. Gilmore said.The diagonals will be extended above the building’s 224-foot parapet, up the sides of the south tower, with two digital signs 55 feet tall and 54 feet wide.In addition, 13 5-foot-tall, high-definition plasma screens at street level and 17 additional 6-foot-square high-definition L.E.D. screens on the east and west facades will be programmable; and on those facades, there will be two 27-by-24-foot digital signs. There will also be a 54-by-32-foot active sign at the south facade. Advertising possibilities for the sign are so robust that Walgreen plans to sell space to its suppliers for promotions. The company would not say how much it spent on the sign, but billboard advertisers said a sign of this size would cost at least $15 million. The billboard is not guaranteed to boast about its size forever. An entrepreneur in downtown Los Angeles has promised to install two 14-story animated billboards celebrating “Blade Runner,” the 1982 dystopian science-fiction film. That project has yet to win approval from city agencies and overcome community opposition. Meanwhile, a nebula of diodes will shine from 1 Times Square. “It’s going to light up that canyon near 42nd Street,” Mr. Gilmore said, “and give you a suntan.”\n",

Given how often machines need repair, it sounds like a good idea. But according to Consumer Reports, there are only two cases where extended warranties are worth buying: rear-projection TV sets and Apple computers. The premium for warranties, Consumer Reports says, amounts to “a sucker’s bet” on “a series of events happening at precisely the right time under precisely the right circumstances.” Even if they do, the cost of repairs is rarely more than the cost of the premium. Even those who prefer the peace of mind a warranty seems to offer are sometimes distressed by what they do and do not get for their money. Service technicians like Dean Landers, who owns Landers Appliance in Baltimore and is president of United Servicers Association, a trade group, complain that they often face angry customers who call for repairs, assuming both parts and labor are covered by warranty, only to find out that’s not the case. “Consumers seldom read the fine print, and the devil is in the details,” Mr. Landers said. “They buy extended warranties based on what salespeople tell them, and salespeople are trying to make a sale.” Approximately $27.8 billion worth of major appliances were purchased by American consumers last year. Americans spend another $1.6 billion a year on appliance warranties, according to Warranty Week.The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers has no official position on warranties; Jill A. Notini, a spokeswoman, wrote by e-mail that, “like many trade associations,” her group “cannot, for legal reasons,” discuss them. Asked whether they recommend extended warranties, Whirlpool, which according to Longbow Research makes about 44 percent of major appliances sold in this country (including the Maytag, Jenn-Air, Amana and sometimes Kenmore brands), Electrolux (Frigidaire) and Samsung all said that decision was up to consumers. \n",
            "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/technology/companies/29soft.html?searchResultPosition=3;2009-05-29;technology;Bloodied by Google, Microsoft Tries Again on Search;REDMOND, Wash.  Microsoft has been bloodied and repeatedly humbled in its battle with Google in online search. That explains why Steven A. Ballmer, the typically bullish and boisterous chief executive of Microsoft, is speaking cautiously about his company’s latest volley against Google, a new version of its search engine that Mr. Ballmer demonstrated publicly for the first time at a technology conference on Thursday. “I’m optimistic that we’re taking a big first step,” Mr. Ballmer said in an interview last week. “And yet I want to be realistic. We’ve got to take a lot more steps.”Many missteps have already been made. Despite investing heavily in search engine technology over the years, Microsoft has watched Google steadily erode at its market share. This time it is taking a more precise approach, working to help searchers with specific online tasks. ImageFor shopping searches, one of Bing's four \"verticals,\" the service offers results that go beyond the 10 blue links of traditional search.  The other verticals are travel, health and local.Microsoft will back its latest release with one of the biggest marketing efforts in its history. And it has come up with a new name, Bing, that will replace the confusing Live Search.The stakes for Microsoft are high. Search has become the central tool for navigating the Web, and ads tied to search results are becoming a more important piece of the advertising market. Microsoft is so eager to catch up that it bid nearly $50 billion last year to buy Yahoo, the No. 2 search company behind Google. Mr. Ballmer said he was no longer interested in buying Yahoo, but still hoped the companies would team up to take on Google in search, and talks on a partnership are continuing. For now, Microsoft is proceeding on its own. Bing represents more than a year of research showing that while users say they are generally satisfied with Web search services, their behavior suggests that they often stumble as they rely on searches to complete certain tasks. ImageWhen the mouse pointer moves over a search result, Bing shows a preview of the destination page so users have an idea of where they will go if they click.\n",
            " Those include things like deciding what camera to buy, where to go on a trip or how to better understand a medical diagnosis. Bing offers an array of new features that are aimed at simplifying those tasks and it is meant to eventually expand to cover more of them. “We are pushing beyond the way search works today,” said Yusuf Mehdi, senior vice president for Microsoft’s online audience business group. The most noticeable new feature in Bing is what Microsoft executives call a table of contents, a navigation rail that allows users to refine their searches and that changes with each query.  A search for the singer Taylor Swift, for instance, gives users the option to zero in on things like images, videos, lyrics and tickets. A search for Elvis Presley will offer slightly different options  no tickets, but a fan club. ImageThe travel vertical uses technology from Farecast, a company that Microsoft acquired. \n",
            "In a search for Honda Civic, the top suggested refinement is the word “used,” but in one for Hyundai Sonata it is “problems,” because search data suggests that those are the most frequent follow-up queries associated with those cars. In many cases, Bing also extracts information from Web pages and presents it an easy-to-digest format. A search for U.P.S. will deliver a search box to track parcels, as well as a phone number for customer service. A search for “Terminator Salvation” will display movie times at nearby theaters. Bing also presents more detailed results in four search categories  travel, health, shopping and local. In browsing the shopping area for a Canon camera, for instance, Bing extracts and displays information from reviews. Bing, which is to be available to the public by next Wednesday at www.bing.com, is not alone in its evolution away from the traditional 10 blue links that search engines have displayed for years. ImageIn its local vertical, Bing extracts content from reviews to show whether reviewers were positive or negative about things like a restaurant's atmosphere or food quality.\n",
            " Google has long blended images, news articles and videos in search results, and recently began offering ways to refine searches. Yahoo also presents movie times and is working to extract information like reviews from Web pages. But with Bing, Microsoft appears to have pushed the changes into more subject areas than its rivals. Whether that translates into success depends on many unknowns, including whether Microsoft’s search results are generally as helpful as Google’s, as the company’s executives say.“There are things where they are going to be superior to Google,” said Danny Sullivan, a search specialist and the editor of the SearchEngineLand blog. “But it is not a game changer. The features are not going to instantly compel people to switch.” Mr. Sullivan cautioned that Google might be able to quickly match anything that Microsoft has done that proves compelling with users. ImageThe health vertical includes content from Microsoft partners that publish health information. \n",
            "Others say Microsoft’s biggest challenge may be persuading enough users to try Bing.“There is not a perceived market problem with search that needs fixing,” said Bryan Wiener, chief executive of 360i, a digital marketing agency. “They have a marketing challenge in convincing consumers that there is reason to look beyond Google.”That is where Bing’s marketing campaign comes in. The company is planning to spend more than $100 million, making this one of its biggest campaigns. When deals with partners are included, like agreements that have already been announced with Hewlett-Packard, Dell and Verizon to give the search engine prime placement on PCs and phones, the marketing effort reaches several hundred million dollars, according to people familiar with Bing’s marketing plan, who asked not to be named because details are confidential.In April, Microsoft accounted for 8.2 percent of searches in the United States, a small fraction of Google’s 64.2 percent, according to comScore. Yahoo’s share was 20.4 percent. Mr. Ballmer expressed confidence in Bing. “I hope over the next year we’ll see small results,” Mr. Ballmer said. Mixing confidence with a dose of realism, he added: “Big as a percentage of our share and small as a percentage, maybe, of Google’s share.”\n",

No one seemed impressed that I had already stored on it practically all of Trollope and six volumes of Gibbon’s “History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,” along with the latest Lee Child and Dennis Lehane. But I got a reaction when I pressed a button and the slim, envelope-size device read aloud to us, in a bossy, robotic female voice, from “Leadbetter’s Quick Tips: The Very Best Short Lessons to Fix Any Part of Your Game”: “As you step up to the ball, breathe through your nose, then exhale and whistle as you start the club back.” For the rest of the weekend my playing partner referred to the Kindle, somewhat warily, as “The Future.”It’s not. The reading device of the future will surely be backlighted, unlike the Kindle, so you can read in the dark. It will have different typefaces, and will reproduce photographs and illustrations in something better than a murky gray wash. The read-aloud voice will learn how to pronounce “Barack Obama” and will have mastered a tone more expressive than that of the tiresome know-it-all who talks to you from inside your car’s G.P.S.In the future airlines will also conclude that you don’t have to turn off a reading device during takeoff and landing. On the way back from South Carolina I had to dash into an airport bookshop for a backup paperback, which sort of defeats the whole point.But if the Kindle isn’t the future, exactly, it’s a precursor. What it tells you, even if you are an unreconstructed book lover, is that the future will not be as hard to get used to as you imagined. Books are heavy, the Kindle reminds you, and they take up a lot of room. (I wish I’d had a Kindle last summer, when on a nearly monthlong trip to China I lugged along an entire suitcase full of books just so I wouldn’t run out of something to read.) And though we think of them as permanent, our books are slowly combusting right there on the shelves, the pages growing yellow, the bindings stiffening and becoming brittle. One of the odder sensations of reading on the Kindle, though, is a sensation of eternal presentness. Your books are all there, perfectly preserved. The device even remembers exactly what page you were on last. On the other hand, as you read along, there are very few cues to how near you are to the beginning, how far from the end. You’re always in the middle. ImageThe slim, envelope-size Kindle is undeniably convenient, even for the curmudgeonly.Credit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesThere is, of course, the problem of eternal sameness. Set in the same typeface, everything on the Kindle looks exactly like everything else, except that some books and publications occasionally turn up with unjustified margins, and for some reason a James Patterson novel I tried to read decided to dispense with apostrophes. Poetry, because the screen is so narrow, sometimes looks bad, and so do plays in verse. And you can’t help missing the pleasing variety and design of books, the dust jackets, the illustrations, the layout of the page.Then there is the problem of finding your way around. Though you can search for a word or a phrase in a Kindle text, it’s hard to skim or jump ahead. That limitation is particularly frustrating with newspapers and magazines, which arrive without tables of contents and can only be viewed section by section and in the order that articles appear.Trying to read The New Yorker on the Kindle, for example, is a lot like reading that magazine back in the days when it didn’t have a table of contents and you learned what was in it only while flipping through to look at the cartoons  except that on the Kindle the cartoons are all sequestered together, so small and gray they’re scarcely worth bothering with.And yet these days, as often as not, I read The New Yorker on my Kindle because, like the papers, it arrives silently overnight via the device’s permanent wireless connection, sooner and more reliably than my print subscription, which sometimes takes a week. Sometimes I remember to look at the print version to see if there’s anything I missed, and sometimes I don’t. Similarly, though I don’t think that reading the newspaper on a Kindle remotely compares with reading the real thing (or even with reading the paper online, for that matter; there are almost no photographs), on a shameful number of mornings, instead of making the Tony Soprano pajama-walk down to the end of the driveway, I have found myself reaching over to the night table for the seductive white gizmo. It’s like having an invisible butler bring you the paper while you’re still in bed. Papers, I should say. For a while, before the monthly payments started to mount up (they run from about $6 to $15), I was getting half a dozen, including The Times of London and The Independent.Most of us have become so used to reading on screen by now that we’ve probably become brainwashed a little. Compared with your computer screen the Kindle actually looks a little more like real ink on real paper. Essentially the device presents you with a tradeoff. You endure sensory deprivation  sacrificing the pleasure of spreading the newspaper out on the kitchen table, forgoing the feel, heft and texture of a book, or the crispness and shimmer of a well-designed magazine  for the sake of portability and convenience.And if you’re at all like me, it’s surprising how easily you succumb to convenience, and how little you miss, once they’re gone, all the niceties of typography and design that you used to value so much. Those things still matter, and I don’t think that books will ever disappear  newspapers and magazines are another matter  but it may be that in the future we will keep them around as fond relics, reminders of what reading used to be like.ImageKindle is not ideal for displaying poetry, like Byron, left. But it lets old favorites, like Eugene O’Neill, right, travel anywhere.Credit...Tony Cenicola/The New York TimesAmong other things, we’ll probably recall that reading used to be more expensive. At the moment Amazon, which makes the Kindle, is selling new books for the device at a heavy discount  under $10 in most cases. Books in the public domain are an even better bargain. I bought all six of Trollope’s Palliser novels, which would easily cost $50 or $60 in paperback, for just 99 cents. Same for “Decline and Fall.” Books for the Kindle are so cheap and so accessible, turning up on your device within seconds, that you wind up buying them impulsively and almost indiscriminately. One evening my wife wanted to check a passage from “Dombey and Son,” which she had been listening to in the car. Ninety-nine cents, a typed-in phrase and, bingo, there it was. Another time I overheard a colleague praising Philipp Meyer’s first novel, “American Rust,” and for $9.99 I had snagged it even before she was out of earshot. The keyboard on the Kindle is designed for fingers more microscopic than mine, and the joystick that controls everything is similarly small and so sensitive that on at least one occasion I have inadvertently purchased the wrong book. I could delete it if I want, but why bother? Shelf space on the Kindle is practically infinite.The same, unfortunately, cannot be said for the Kindle Bookstore. Most current books are available there, but the backlist is strangely spotty. You can buy John Updike’s posthumous book “Endpoint,” but not any of his Rabbit novels; Philip Roth’s “Indignation,” but not “Sabbath’s Theater.” The poetry selection is particularly skimpy  no Larkin, no Elizabeth Bishop, no Wallace Stevens  but there is an extensive selection of 19th-century erotica by the very prolific Anonymous. One useful feature is a provision that enables you to look at a free sample of a book before deciding whether or not to purchase. This is what convinced me that I needed “Leadbetter’s Quick Tips,” for example, but also told me that I could probably skip Valerie J. Wood’s 2002 hockey novel “Enforcer,” about a player named Cal Bowman, a “lean mean skating machine, one of the league’s best fighters, who other teams’ enforcers are eager to taunt, torment, and try to pound into a disabled, bloody mess.”Over time the selection of books available will doubtless improve, and in the meanwhile for a small fee, you can wirelessly download material from your own computer. Also for 99 cents  the default price apparently  you can subscribe for a month to one of any number of blogs, including Gawker and Fashionista. You will never run out of stuff to read, in other words, and you can take it all with you wherever you go  except possibly the shower. After shelling out $359 for my Kindle I have been reluctant to test the waterproofing. The screen is small, though not as small as the iPhone’s, on which you can also read books  and if you’re a fast reader, the wait while the tiny black particles realign themselves on the screen after you turn the page is annoying. Yet in many ways the Kindle experience is reading reduced to its essence: deciphering marks on a slate. To say you appreciate written language more when it’s transmitted this way, without the familiar delivery mechanism of paper, print and binding, would be a stretch, but after a while you don’t appreciate it any less.\n",

Designers, especially those showing outside the fair, channeled their inner imp, producing pieces that reminded us that design can be both functional and whimsical at the same time. This represents a refreshing change from the recent proliferation of design art, which, with its myopic focus on making high-priced objets for hedge-fund managers, almost succeeded at stifling real inspiration before it crashed and burned along with the economy. This year, the target audience ran less toward hedge-fund managers than it did to, say, would-be roadies.

And you can spice up the dullest dinner party with the Dutch designer Marcel Wanders’s elegantly louche Can Can light for Flos, with its naughty set of ruffles peeking out from beneath a sleek, minimalist shade. Ooh la la! Post-Modernism  the historicist and ornament-obsessed movement that was one of 20th century design’s most fun-centric  reared its subversive head again in a new version of Alessandro Mendini’s famous Proust armchair for Cappellini. In this one, a geometric-patterned fabric replaced the pointillist design of the 1978 original. But two of the most charming examples of this year’s mischievous spirit were also the most modest. Outside the fair, Pagani Perversi’s Saily light, made for the ambitious new design company Skitsch, had a shade that looked like a boat made out of folded newspaper, but the material was decidedly high-tech: a fire-resistant paper from DuPont. And no discussion of playfulness would be complete without mentioning the Italian company Campeggi, which has long been delighting Milan fairgoers with its ingenious, winsome designs for inflatable beds and sleep sofas that put American versions to shame. The company, alas, has had no United States distribution, but it is working on that. So when it does, those of you who need a stylish guest bed that fits unobtrusively into your tiny New York apartment or your college dorm room can snap up Campeggi’s Tent sofa by the young Canadian designer Philippe Malouin (who is featured in “Form Follows Fun” on Page 61). In a clever play on the idea of camping out, its tentlike superstructure offers overnight guests an extra measure of privacy in their hosts’ living rooms. Sweet. [?][?][?] PILAR VILADAS\n",

After months of, uh, searching, Microsoft settled on Bing to replace the all-too-forgettable Live Search, which itself replaced MSN Search. Microsoft invested billions of dollars in those services and failed to slow Google’s rise, so a new name certainly can’t hurt.Microsoft’s marketing gurus hope that Bing will evoke neither a type of cherry nor a strip club on “The Sopranos” but rather a sound  the ringing of a bell that signals the “aha” moment when a search leads to an answer.The name is meant to conjure “the sound of found” as Bing helps people with complex tasks like shopping for a camera, said Yusuf Mehdi, senior vice president of Microsoft’s online audience business group.And if Bing turns into a verb like, say, Xerox, TiVo or, well, Google, that would be nice too. Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, said Thursday that he liked Bing’s potential to “verb up.” Plus, he said, “it works globally, and doesn’t have negative, unusual connotations.”Some branding experts said choosing the name Bing was a good start, but also the easiest part of the challenge facing the company, since most people turn to Google without even thinking about it.  Michael Cronan, whose consulting firm helped come up with brands like TiVo and Amazon’s Kindle, said Bing’s sound, brevity and “ing” ending were all positives.  “It has a promise that you are going to find what you are looking for, and that’s great,” Mr. Cronan said. “But its success is entirely wrapped up in the quality of the experience that Microsoft can deliver.”Peter Sealey, a former chief marketing officer at the Coca-Cola Company, said Microsoft should have picked a name that more directly connotes search. “Bing has no equity; it signals nothing,” Mr. Sealey said. “It is going to be an enormous expense to create an image for this thing called Bing.”Google’s name is a play on the word googol, which is a 1 followed by 100 zeroes. The company has said the name speaks to its ambitious mission to organize all the world’s information.Asked about Microsoft’s choice of name at a press conference on Wednesday, Sergey Brin, a Google co-founder, said he did not know enough about the new service to comment on it. Then he deadpanned: “We’ve been pretty happy with the name Google.” Meanwhile, some tech people were already noting that Bing is also an unfortunate acronym: “But It’s Not Google.”\n",
            "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/31/magazine/31wwln-medium-t.html?searchResultPosition=2;2009-05-31;magazine;Lights! Camera! Inaction!; Anyone who has followed fantasy football or an eBay auction at the office — and gotten away with it — knows that many of our everyday activities now look like work. Typing and scrolling and peering at a computer, you could be doing anything: e-mail, accounting, short-selling, browsing porn, buying uranium, getting divorced. This odd accident of life online — the increasing visual homogeneity of our behaviors — may be a boon to procrastinators, hobbyists and multitaskers. But it has some victims. I don’t mean bosses concerned with productivity (who cares about them?). The crowd truly stymied by the merging of human activities are filmmakers. If fighting now looks like making up now looks like booking travel, as it does when people conduct their affairs online, how do film directors make human action both dramatic to viewers and roughly true to life? In the past 10 to 15 years, Hollywood producers have devised various solutions. In the ’90s, filmmakers made a broad, corny character of the Internet, studding movies with close-ups of on-the-nose screen bulletins like “Unrecognized System Virus” (“The Net,” 1995) or “You Have Mail” (“You’ve Got Mail,” 1998). But movies about the Web soon lost their energy, especially as the novelty of communications technology faded. Now canny producers opt either to devise ways to recapitulate classical stagecraft in a digital environment — as when characters give soliloquies on cellphones (“The Insider,” 1999) — or to sidestep the fact of the Internet almost entirely (“The Sopranos,” 1999-2007).As a genre, the thriller has been most inventive in representing the Internet. “Damages,” the ripping legal thriller on FX, has taken an approach that borders on camp. Neither a period piece like “Mad Men” nor a series set among a low-tech population like “Friday Night Lights,” “Damages” is set among 21st-century white-collar criminals and corporate lawyers: a singularly tech-happy set. Still, no character on “Damages” ever so much as sends an e-mail message if he can drive 100 miles to have a face-to-face showdown with someone in a lush natural setting or a fearsome dark alley. There’s humor and intelligence in this choice. Like Faulkner, who sometimes seemed to spite Hollywood by writing sentences that were deliberately unfilmable (despite being a screenwriter himself), the creators of “Damages” compose scenes that reject the technological givens of modern life and use traditional blocking that seems straight out of Shakespeare. Actions are suited to words. Characters meet in twos and threes; they scrutinize, seduce, stalk, retreat, manipulate, distract and attack. The distinctive noir of “Damages” is possible because the series doesn’t reach for verisimilitude. The long-running Fox drama “24” works otherwise. It features brazen product placement by personal-tech companies like Sprint, Garmin and Nextel. Characters live on phones and at computers; their real-life surroundings are austere, spartan, practically black and white. The rococo action of the series is mental. It takes place in the digital ether. Though “24” is bound to look more primitive, as drama that admits the primacy of online life becomes a more sophisticated art, the mise-en-scène is still stunning. The high anxiety it renders so beautifully is the anxiety of ordinary life. Here’s a thriller for everyone: How have we become so intimate with machines that seem by turns so necessary, so enervating, so treacherous and so unpredictable?Clusters of characters on “24” regularly participate in speakerphone calls, for example. In these scenes, they confront not other faces during heated exchanges, but phones and devices. These encounters with talking technology — showdowns between man and machine — would come off like sci-fi if experiences like conference calls weren’t now part of the standard office routine. When consequential words come from far off into a room of you and your colleagues, do you look at the phone, the middle distance, others in the room with you? This is a director’s call, and the choices in “24” make high drama of the minor eye movements and hand movements of digital experience. ImageCredit...Kevin Van AelstWhat’s more, computer screens on “24” supply scenes with lunar-looking ambient light. Occasionally the series even splits its screen to show a computer interface set against a character who looks only more slightly lifelike. Characters inhabit two worlds at once: the spatiotemporal world of bodies and things, and the online world of information and pixels. Even sickbed scenes, which in 20th-century cinema are visceral tableaus that center on flesh and blood, come off robotic on “24.” Screens and monitors dominate the room. No wonder the attention of “24” characters is often divided — fatally — between real-world interplay and the screens that tyrannize their attention.  The recent feature film “State of Play” doesn’t try to spite technology or make a character of it. Instead, it puts on screen the very antagonism that bedevils filmmakers: the one between technology and drama. The movie turns an investigative reporter named Cal McAffrey (played by Russell Crowe) into a figure for analog values, including experience, memory, face-to-face interaction, moral ambiguity, dirt and ink. Initially, Cal assumes (fearfully) that “life” must exist in opposition to the Internet. Whenever he’s confronted with the profits, presumptions and conventions of the Web, he balks. You can imagine that his cry from the heart strikes a chord with traditional filmmakers as well as newspapermen. (Shouted at the Web, “This isn’t reporting!” could easily be “This isn’t filmmaking!”) For its part, the Internet plays an endearing straw man in “State of Play.” In one scene, Cal is shown surveying the Web site of a big company while he seeks out a corporate informer on the phone. “I need someone to dig a little deeper,” he says, meaning, presumably, deeper than the corporation’s home page. As Cal sets out to prove to the blogger Della Frye (Rachel McAdams), real reporting requires grit and shoe leather. His saltiness is silly, but he’s plainly right; only the shallowest investigations can be conducted on the Internet alone. At the same time, the film gives Della a legitimate hearing. A digital habitué, she’s drawn — as the best bloggers are — to documentation and verifiable facts; she resists narrative sleights of hand; she’s at ease with a hybrid of professional and personal life; she’s not sentimental about the booze, misery and squalor that Cal stipulates are hallmarks of the reporter’s life.Nonetheless, it’s Della who delivers the Luddite message at the film’s end, when she and Cal have saved the day with a front-page story. “With a piece this big,” she says, “people should probably have newsprint on their hands when they read it.”The line’s a groaner, perhaps — I heard actual groans in an L.A. theater — but it tracks with the film’s logic: life before the Internet, as well as modern-day life offline, is dirtier than life online. It’s less anonymous. It’s less aloof. Participants touch one another and get sullied and stained and implicated. This friction and filth may bring people closer to certain kinds of stories, but it may also produce certain kinds of stories. Della and Cal’s front-page article — which is, through the course of the movie, retrieved in stinky places, including underground tunnels and open-air fish markets — may be best understood in ink. But for reporters or filmmakers bent on getting the truth, the Internet should be boisterously confronted (as on “24”) or ironically bracketed (as on “Damages”) but not limply wished out of existence (as in most mediocre entertainment). The Internet is reality now, a vast reality, at least as weird and complex a place as a soot-stained city or a scorching desert. As many problems as the Internet presents for traditional forms of representation, every serious journalist and filmmaker misses a big chance when he refuses to contend with it. Points of Entry: THIS WEEK’S RECOMMENDATIONS THE ONLY WINNING MOVE IS NOT TO PLAY: Oh, but it’s way too late for that. To conjure the Internet in the old days, plan a Netflix festival. Include the bad and the good: “War Games” (1983), “The Net” (1995), “Hackers” (1995), “You’ve Got Mail” (1998), “The Matrix” (1999) and the bubble-era documentary “Startup.com” (2001). ON THE CLOCK: “24,” the real-time espionage thriller, has run for seven seasons, and the next one starts in January (that’s T-minus 214+ days). In the meantime, watch full episodes of the show, and get extras, facts and ads for Sprint at Fox’s slick Web site, fox.com/24.  BEEB: Before the “State of Play” DVD is out — and if you miss it in the theater — try the BBC miniseries “State of Play,” which inspired the American movie. It makes less hay than the movie does of the Web-print divide, but themes of old and new still drive the drama. It’s also just an awesomely twisted thriller.

            "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/education/29aris.html?searchResultPosition=3;2009-05-29;education;Web Site Lets Parents Track Data on Students;After several months of delays, a Web site that offers an interactive portfolio of public school students’ test scores, grades and attendance rates will be available for all parents by the end of June, the Department of Education said on Thursday.The announcement came at a critical moment for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg: lawmakers in Albany are weighing whether to renew the law giving the mayor control over city schools, which expires June 30, and chief among their concerns has been the way the mayor and his schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, have treated parents.Critics have said Chancellor Klein in particular has consistently turned a deaf ear to voices from the outside, including parents’ complaints that the pressures to prepare for tests have supplanted quality instruction in schools.On Thursday, Mr. Klein sought to show a sweeter side of his accountability efforts with a colorful, sometimes whimsical Web site that was created for the city school system, under a city contract. It features cartoon characters explaining the difference, for instance, between performance levels 3 and 4 on state math tests. Mr. Klein called the Web site, known as Parent Link, a “powerful tool” that would allow parents to work more closely with teachers to help their children.“This will let them use and understand the information so it’s not just a score,” he said after a news conference at Public School 85 in Astoria, Queens. “That’s the magic of this.”On the site, parents will be able to view overall course grades and scores on state tests, but not individual scores on class assignments. They will also be able to see attendance histories and look at the probability of a student passing state math and English exams, based on how they have scored on periodic city tests. It will also show how their child is doing compared with children at schools serving similar student populations.The Parent Link site, which is available in nine languages, is part of an $80 million data and information initiative developed by I.B.M., known as the Achievement Reporting and Innovation System, or ARIS. The Parent Link site cost the city about $900,000 to establish, according to the Department of Education.ARIS, which had been hailed by I.B.M. and city officials as a revolutionary product that would allow educators to pinpoint deficiencies in student learning and share effective strategies, has been slow to take off. Principals in New York City have been using the system for two years, and teachers since last November. Some principals grew so frustrated with its quirks last fall that they improvised their own data management systems. Since then, the Department of Education has improved the system, and it is now easy to use, said Chiara Coletti, a spokeswoman for the principals’ union.In January 2008, Mayor Bloomberg declared in his State of the City address that parents would gain access to the site beginning in the fall. In October, education officials said parents would get access in two months. The city operated the system as a pilot program at three schools last fall and expanded its use this spring. Mr. Klein said security concerns and last-minute fine-tuning had caused some of the delays. “You always wish you could get it out earlier,” he said. Ann Gordon-Chang, principal of P.S. 85, one of the pilot schools, said the system changed the way parents thought about test data. She recalled a parent who was considering taking her child out of school but changed her mind after looking at test scores and seeing that progress was within reach.“Parents are more informed,” Ms. Gordon-Chang said. “They can be very focused on working with teachers to help students.”\n",
            "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/31/magazine/31wwln-consumed-t.html?searchResultPosition=4;2009-05-31;magazine;Say What?; PLINKY It has never been easier to express yourself in public. Whatever you might want to say, the online tools to let you say it to a (theoretically) worldwide audience are innumerable. Say it long, say it short, say what you want, when you want and how often you want. As the title of a forthcoming book about blog culture puts it: “Say Everything.” You have the technology. The only thing the technology cannot do is solve this problem: What if you don’t really have anything to express? Ah, but technology can solve that problem for you. Plinky.com, which officially went online in January, exists specifically to offer what it calls prompts, meant to inspire interesting thoughts to share with the world. Users respond on Plinky.com and can feed their answers to their own blogs, or to their Twitter or Facebook accounts. Its chief executive and founder, Jason Shellen, worked for the company Pyra Labs, which created the pioneering software Blogger, and stuck around when Google bought that firm. Blogger continued to attract more users, but “people were struggling with what to say,” he says. “They could create a blog; we’d made it easy enough to do that piece. But they were struggling with what to put out there — ‘Do I talk about personal things? Do I talk about work? What do I do?’ ”Frankly, this sounds unfathomable. The Web is a vast sloshing sea of individuals, sharing what would seem to encompass every conceivable thought about foreign policy, financial bailouts, the N.B.A. playoffs, delays at O’Hare, the new “keyboard cat” video, that jerk in the next cubicle and being bored. There’s a reason the word “oversharing” has entered the vernacular, yes? ImageCredit...Peter ArkleThat’s not the whole story, Shellen insists. While the history of the Web is at least partly the development of a Moore’s Law of expressive ease — it seems to take half as much effort to say twice as much every couple of years — this has had side effects. With so much chatter, how do you say something that will be part of a conversation rather than a monologue in a virtual empty room? “There’s been a little bit of the death of the shared experience,” is how Shellen puts it. He points to the popularity of gimmicky questionnaires that circulate widely on Facebook, like “25 Things You Don’t Know About Me,” “5 Cities You’ve Lived In” and “5 Albums You Love,” (or my personal favorite, “5 People You’d Like to Punch in the Face”). Similar tropes have circulated among bloggers as they tag one another; the upshot seems to be that sociability demands structure. Thus Plinky’s daily prompts: Which movie’s characters would you befriend in real life? What will you do when the zombies come? Who would win a fight between a bear and a shark? Plinky users responded to that last question by the hundreds. A prompt about songs for a road trip got more than 2,000 replies, making it the most popular query to date. The intentionally innocuous nature of the prompts makes them reminiscent of canned cocktail-party conversation starters. The difference is that while a tongue-tied party guest can at least try to cultivate an air of brooding mystery that might lead someone else to start the conversation, the Internet wallflower is totally invisible. Chime in, or you’re forgotten. Thus a Plinky slogan: “Hey, didn’t you use to have a blog?” Poignant.Nicholas Carr, who is at work on a book, tentatively titled “The Shallows,” about the culture of instant information, points out that blogs evolved from something to be updated on occasion to being updated daily, then many times a day; now social media services invite updates hourly, or constantly. “There’s a subtle, or not so subtle, form of competition,” he says. “You’re getting this constant stream of updates of whatever everyone else is doing; it kind of creates pressure that if you want to be in the flow, you also have to contribute. Frequently.”Like the various “Top 5 Things” on Facebook, then, Plinky is an automated version of the person at the party who takes an interest and asks you a question. Shellen says his company has more projects in the works that are “centered on conversation” but for the moment has been learning more about what sorts of prompts are effective. He is not even bothered when users chime in to criticize a question. “It still got them to write,” he says. “We’re grist for the mill. We’re just trying to elicit some kind of response.” \n",
            "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/us/politics/29cyber.html?searchResultPosition=5;2009-05-29;us;Pentagon Plans New Arm to Wage Cyberspace Wars;WASHINGTON  The Pentagon plans to create a new military command for cyberspace, administration officials said Thursday, stepping up preparations by the armed forces to conduct both offensive and defensive computer warfare.The military command would complement a civilian effort to be announced by President Obama on Friday that would overhaul the way the United States safeguards its computer networks.Mr. Obama, officials said, will announce the creation of a White House office  reporting to both the National Security Council and the National Economic Council  that will coordinate a multibillion-dollar effort to restrict access to government computers and protect systems that run the stock exchanges, clear global banking transactions and manage the air traffic control system.White House officials say Mr. Obama has not yet been formally presented with the Pentagon plan. They said he would not discuss it Friday when he announced the creation of a White House office responsible for coordinating private-sector and government defenses against the thousands of cyberattacks mounted against the United States  largely by hackers but sometimes by foreign governments  every day. But he is expected to sign a classified order in coming weeks that will create the military cybercommand, officials said. It is a recognition that the United States already has a growing number of computer weapons in its arsenal and must prepare strategies for their use  as a deterrent or alongside conventional weapons  in a wide variety of possible future conflicts. The White House office will be run by a “cyberczar,” but because the position will not have direct access to the president, some experts said it was not high-level enough to end a series of bureaucratic wars that have broken out as billions of dollars have suddenly been allocated to protect against the computer threats. The main dispute has been over whether the Pentagon or the National Security Agency should take the lead in preparing for and fighting cyberbattles. Under one proposal still being debated, parts of the N.S.A. would be integrated into the military command so they could operate jointly. Officials said that in addition to the unclassified strategy paper to be released by Mr. Obama on Friday, a classified set of presidential directives is expected to lay out the military’s new responsibilities and how it coordinates its mission with that of the N.S.A., where most of the expertise on digital warfare resides today.The decision to create a cybercommand is a major step beyond the actions taken by the Bush administration, which authorized several computer-based attacks but never resolved the question of how the government would prepare for a new era of warfare fought over digital networks. It is still unclear whether the military’s new command or the N.S.A.  or both  will actually conduct this new kind of offensive cyberoperations. The White House has never said whether Mr. Obama embraces the idea that the United States should use cyberweapons, and the public announcement on Friday is expected to focus solely on defensive steps and the government’s acknowledgment that it needs to be better organized to face the threat from foes attacking military, government and commercial online systems. Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates has pushed for the Pentagon to become better organized to address the security threat. Initially at least, the new command would focus on organizing the various components and capabilities now scattered across the four armed services. Officials declined to describe potential offensive operations, but said they now viewed cyberspace as comparable to more traditional battlefields. “We are not comfortable discussing the question of offensive cyberoperations, but we consider cyberspace a war-fighting domain,“ said Bryan Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman. “We need to be able to operate within that domain just like on any battlefield, which includes protecting our freedom of movement and preserving our capability to perform in that environment.” Although Pentagon civilian officials and military officers said the new command was expected to initially be a subordinate headquarters under the military’s Strategic Command, which controls nuclear operations as well as cyberdefenses, it could eventually become an independent command. “No decision has been made,” said Lt. Col. Eric Butterbaugh, a Pentagon spokesman. “Just as the White House has completed its 60-day review of cyberspace policy, likewise, we are looking at how the department can best organize itself to fill our role in implementing the administration’s cyberpolicy.”The creation of the cyberczar’s office inside the White House appears to be part of a significant expansion of the role of the national security apparatus there. A separate group overseeing domestic security, created by President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks, now resides within the National Security Council. A senior White House official responsible for countering the proliferation of nuclear and unconventional weapons has been given broader authority. Now, cybersecurity will also rank as one of the key threats that Mr. Obama is seeking to coordinate from the White House. The strategy review Mr. Obama will discuss on Friday was completed weeks ago, but delayed because of continuing arguments over the authority of the White House office, and the budgets for the entire effort. It was kept separate from the military debate over whether the Pentagon or the N.S.A. is best equipped to engage in offensive operations. Part of that debate hinges on the question of how much control should be given to American spy agencies, since they are prohibited from acting on American soil.“It’s the domestic spying problem writ large,” one senior intelligence official said recently. “These attacks start in other countries, but they know no borders. So how do you fight them if you can’t act both inside and outside the United States?” \n",

Other states installing high-tech facial recognition programs may follow the lead of Arkansas, Indiana, Nevada and Virginia in insisting that the citizenry pose with “neutral facial expressions.” Grin and there’ll be retakes until an outlook closer to Grant Wood’s “American Gothic” is achieved. The high-tech software is designed to compare a new license photo with existing ones and signal officials when false or stolen identities may be in the works. The technology gets thrown off the track by smiles. So good citizens must stash their exuberance and wax bland in the interests of personal and national security. Like everything else from plumbing rules to highway speeds, state definitions of a smile are bound to vary. The merest hint of something short of bemusement may make it in Arkansas, one bureaucrat allowed, but no teeth showing and don’t even think of grinning large. Virginia opts to be decidedly unamused. Its camera setting “will send an error message if it detects a non-neutral expression,” an official sternly told a reporter for The Washington Post. In the modern state of heightened wariness, staring like a dullard sounds no more demeaning than walking in your socks through airport security. Most smiles offered up after toiling through the average D.M.V. labyrinth are forced, anyway. So frown. And have a nice day.\n",
